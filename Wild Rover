The Wild Rover

(G) I've been a wild rover for many's the (C) year
and I've (G) spent all my (D) money on whiskey and (G)beer.
But (G) now I'm returning with gold in great (C)store
and I (G) never will (D) play the wild rover no (G) more

(Chorus) And it's (D) no, nay, never, (D7)
no, (G) nay, never, no (C) more
will I (G) play the wild (C) rover
no, (G) never, (D) no (G) more

I went into an ale-house I used to frequent
and I told the landlady my money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay,
Such a custom like yours I can have any day

(Chorus)

Then out of me pocket I took sovereigns bright
and the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.
She said I'd have whiskey and wines of the best
and the words that she told me were only in jest.

(Chorus)

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,
and I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
And when they've caressed me as oft' times before
then I never will play the wild rover no more

(Chorus)
