Back in the Saddle Again

(G)I'm back in the (D)saddle (G)again (G7)
(C)Out where a friend is a (G)friend
Where the (C)longhorn cattle feed
On the lowly (G)gypsum (Em)weed
(A)Back in the (D)saddle (G)again

Ridin' the range once more
Totin' my old .44
Where you sleep out every night
And the only law is right
Back in the saddle again

(C)Whoopi-ty-aye-oh
(G)Rockin' to and fro
back in the saddle (D-D7)again
(C)Whoopi-ty-aye-yay
(G)I go my (Em)way
(A)Back in the (D)saddle (G)again
(Repeat)
