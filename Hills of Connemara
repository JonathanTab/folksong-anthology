Hills of Connemara

Oh (G)gather up your pots and your (C)old tin (G)cans
The mash, and the corn, the (D)barley, and the bran
(G)Run like the devil from the (C)excise (G)man
Keep the smoke from rising, (D)Barney(G)

Now keep your eyes well peeled today
The excise men they're on their way
Searching for the mountain tay
In the hills of Connemara

(Chorus) Gather up your pots and your old tin cans
The mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran
Run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney

Well the mountain breezes as they blow
Echo down to the hills below
Big tall men are on the go
In the hills of connemara
(Chorus)
Well swing to the left, now swing to the right
The excise man they can dance all night
Drinkin 'up the tay 'til the broad daylight
In the hills of Connemara
(Chorus)
Well a gallon for the butcher and big Mick Klein
A bottle for the poor old Father Stein
Keep him off that altar wine
In the hills of Connemara
(Chorus)
Stand your ground, for it's too late
The excise men, they're at the gate
Glory be to paddy, for theyâ€™re drinking it straight
In the hills of Connemara
(Chorus)
