Lily the Pink

Now here's a story, a little bit gory
A little bit happy, a little bit sad
She invented medicinal compound
Tis efficacious in every way.

(Chorus)We’ll drink a’Drink a’Drink
To Lily the Pink the Pink the Pink
The savior of (THE SAVIOR OF!) the human race.
She invented medicinal compound.
Tis efficacious in every way

Now uncle paul, he was terribly small
He was the smallest man around
Then they gave him medicinal compound
Now he’s six feet under ground
(Chorus)
Now Charlie hammer had a terrible stammer
He could hardly say a word
Then they gave him medicinal compound
Now he’s seen but never heard
(Chorus)
Well Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
So they put him in a home
There they gave him medicinal compound
Now he's emperor of rome
(Chorus)
Now Freddie Clinger was an opera singer
He broke glasses with his voice `tis said
But they gave him medicinal compound
Now they break glasses on his head
(Chorus)
A loving couple had a terrible trouble
They just could not procreate
Then they gave them medicinal compound
Instead of one kid they had eight
(Chorus)
(the sound of much wailing)
Now here's the sad part... I can hardly bear to sing it…

Lydia died and went up to heaven
All the Church bells the did ring, (ding dong)
But she brought with her medicinal compound
Hark the herald angels sing!!
(Chorus)
