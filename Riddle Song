The Ridde Song
I (C)gave my love a (F)cherry that had no (C)stone
(G)Gave my love a (C)chicken that had no (G)bone
I (G)gave my love a (C)baby with no cry(G)ing
And (Am)told my love a (F)story that had no (C)end

How can there be a cherry that has no stone?
How can there be a chicken that has no bone?
How can there be a baby with no crying?
How can you tell a story that has no end?

A cherry when it's blooming, it has no stone
And a chicken when it's pipping, there is no bone
A baby when it's sleeping, there's no crying
And when I say "I love you", it has no end

I gave my love a cherry that had no stone
I gave my love a chicken that had no bone
I gave my love a baby with no crying
And told my love a story that had no end
