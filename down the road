Down the Road

(D)Sun is rising (Bm)high(G), burning into the (D)day,
I will say (Bm)goodbye(G), I'll be going away(D),
Brush away my doubts, what tomorrow will (G)hold(D),
Feeling fine for (Bm)now(G), going down the (Bm)road

To a city to sing, about the trees and the wind,
'Bout the hills in spring, and the rivers that bend,
The rocky deep pass, and the poppies and ponies,
Running through the grass, up and down the road

(Chorus) du du du du...

In the dark they sit and they hollar for more,
White smoke in a wisp, from here to the door,
Their admission they paid, for the stories they're told,
Of a clear new day, hold me down on the road
(Chorus) 
So heavy rain at my back, lazy meadows ahead,
In my book I keep track, of the promises said.
For my songs in a town, that tomorrow will hold
Feelin' better for now, facin' down the road.
(Chorus) 
(D)Sun is rising (Bm)high(G), burning into the (D)day,
I will say (Bm)goodbye(G), I'll be going away(D),
Brush away my doubts, what tomorrow will (G)hold(D),
Feeling fine for (Bm)now(G), going down the (Bm)road
(Chorus)
