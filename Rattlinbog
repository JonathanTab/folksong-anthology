 The Rattlin Bog
(Chorus) (G) Ho, ro, the (C) rattlin' bog
The (G) bog down in the (D) valley-o
(G) Ho, ro, the (C) rattlin' bog
The (G) bog down in the (D) valley-o (G)

(G) In that bog there was a tree
A rare tree, a (D) rattlin' tree
(G) The tree in the bog
In the bog down in the (D) valley-o (G)
(Chorus)
And on that tree there was a limb
A rare limb, a rattlin' limb
The limb on the tree... 
(Chorus)
And on that limb there was a branch
A rare branch, a rattlin' branch
The branch on the limb..
(Chorus)
And on that branch there was a twig
A rare twig, a rattlin' twig
The twig on the branch...
(Chorus)
And on that twig there was a nest
A rare nest, a rattlin' nest
The nest on the twig...
(Chorus)
And in that nest there was an egg
A rare egg, a rattlin' egg
The egg in the nest...
(Chorus)
And on that egg there was a bird
A rare bird, a rattlin' bird
The bird on the egg...
(Chorus)
And on that bird there was a feather
A rare feather, a rattlin' feather
The feather on the bird...
(Chorus)
And on that feather there was a flea
A rare flea, a rattlin' flea
The flea in the feather...
(Chorus)
