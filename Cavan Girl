Cavan Girl 

(C)As I walk the (G)road from Kille(Am)shandra, weary, (F)I (G)sat (C)down
For it's twelve long (G)miles ar(Am)ound the (G)lake (F)to get to Cavan Town
Though (C)Oughter (G)and the (Am)road I (G)go (F)once seemed beyond compare
Now I (C)curse the (G)time it (Am)takes to (G)reach my Cavan (F)girl(G), so (C)fair

The Autumn shades are on the leaves, the trees will soon be bare
Each red-coat leaf around me seems the colour of her hair
My gaze retreats, defies my feet, and once again I sigh
As the broken pool of sky reminds the colour of her eyes

At the Cavan cross each Sunday morning, where she can be found
And she seems to have the eye of every boy in Cavan Town
If my luck will hold I'll have the golden summer of her smile
And to break the hearts of Cavan men she'll talk to me a while

So next Sunday evening finds me homeward, Killeshandra bound
To work the week 'til I return to court in Cavan Town
When asked if she would be my bride, at least she'd not say no
So next Sunday morning I'll rouse myself and back to her, I'll go
