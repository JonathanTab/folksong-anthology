Sweet Violets

(Chorus) Sweet Violets
Sweeter than all the roses
Covered all over from head to toe
Covered all over with sweet violets

There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a LECTURE
On horses and chickens and eggs
And told her that she had such beautiful
MANNERS that suited a girl of her charms
A girl that he wanted to take in his
WASHING and ironing and then if she did
They could get married and raise lots of
(Chorus)
The girl told the farmer that he'd better stop
And she called her father and he called a
TAXI and got there before very long
'Cause some one was doin' his little girl
RIGHT for a change and so that's why he said
If you marry her son, you're better off SINGLE
'Cause it's always been my belief
Marriage will bring a man nothing but
(Chorus)
The farmer decided heâ€™d wed anyway
And started in planning for his wedding
SUIT which he purchased for only one buck
But then he found out he was just out of
MONEY and so he got left in the lurch
A standin' and waitin' in front of the
END of the story which just goes to show
All a girl wants from a man is his
(Chorus)
