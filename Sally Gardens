Sally Gardens

It was (G) down by the (D) Sally (C) gar-(G)-dens
My (C) love and (D) I did (G) meet
She (G) crossed the (D) Sally (C) gar-(G)-dens
With (C) little (D) snow-white (G) feet
 
(Chorus) She (G) bid me to (C) take life (D) easy
As the (Em) leaves grow (C) on (D) the (G) tree
But (Em) I was (D) young and (C) fool-(G)-ish
And with (C) her did (D) not (G) agree
 
In a field down by the river
My love and I did stand
And upon my leaning shoulder
She laid her snow-white hand
 
She bid me take life easy
As the grass grows on the weirs
But I was young and foolish
And now I am full of tears
 
(Repeat 1st verse and refrain)
