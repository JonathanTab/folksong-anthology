Sixteen Tons

(Am)Some people say a (G)man is (F)made outta (E)mud
A (Am)poor man's (G)made outta (F)muscle and (E)blood
(Am)Muscle and (G)blood and (F)skin and (E)bone
A (Am)mind that's weak and a (E)back that's (Am)strong

(Chorus) You load sixteen tons what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
St Peter don't call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I owe my soul I owe my soul to the company store

Well I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of Number 9 coal
The straw boss said well bless my soul
(Chorus)
Well I was born one morning it was drizzlin' rain
Fighting and trouble thatâ€™s my middle name
I was raised in the woods by an old mama lion
Ain't no high toned woman make me walk the line
(Chorus)
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't a lotta men died
One fist of iron the other one steel
If the right one don't get you then the left one will
