The Ring of Fire 

(G)Love is a (C)burning (G)thing
And it makes a (D)firery (G)ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

(Chorus) (D)I fell into a (G)burning ring of fire
I went (D)down, down, down
And the (G)flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The (C)ring of (G)fire
The (D)ring of (G)fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
(Chorus 2x)
