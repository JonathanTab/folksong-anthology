O Flower of Scotland

O flower of Scotland
When will we see your like again?
That fought and died for
Your wee bit Hill and Glen
(Chorus) And stood against him
         Proud Edward's Army
         And sent him homeward tae think again
         
The Hills are bare now
And Autumn leaves lie thick and still
O'er land that is lost now
Which those so dearly held
(Chorus)
Those days are past now
And in the past they must remain
But we can still rise now
And be the nation again
(Chorus)
The Hills are bare now
And Autumn leaves lie thick and still
O'er land that is lost now
That though so dearly held
O Flower of Scotland
When will we see your like again?
That fought and died for
Your wee bit Hill and Glen
(Chorus)
