Star of the County Down

In (Em) Banbridge Town in the (G) County (D) Down
One (Em) morning (C) last (D) July,
From a (Em) boreen green came a (G) sweet (D) colleen
And she (Em) smiled as she (D) passed me (Em) by.
She (G) looked so sweet from her (D) two bare feet
To the (Em) sheen of her (C) nut brown (D) hair.
Such a (Em) coaxing elf, sure I (G) shook (D) myself
For to (Em) see I was (D) really (Em) there.
 
[Chorus]From (G) Bantry Bay up to (D) Derry Quay and
From (Em) Galway to (C) Dublin (D) Town,
No (Em) maid I've seen like the (G) brown (D) colleen
That I (Em) met in the (D) County (Em) Down.
 
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head,
And I looked with a feelin' rare,
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by,
"Whose the maid with the nut brown hair"?
He smiled at me and he says, say's he,
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the star of the County Down".
[Chorus]
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes,
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust colored brown.
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.
[Chorus]
