The Gambler   

(D)On a warm summer's evening
On a (G)train bound for (D)nowhere
I met up with a gambler
We were both too tired to (A)sleep
So (D)we took turns a-starin'
Out the (G)window at the (D)darkness
The boredom overtook us
(A)And he began to (D)speak

He said, "Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes.
So if you don't mind my sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice."

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy,
You gotta learn to play it right.

(Chorus) (D)You got to know when to hold 'em,
         (G)Know when to (D)fold 'em,
         (G)Know when to (D)walk away,
         (D)And know when to (A)run.
         You never (D)count your money
         When you're (G)sittin' at the (D)table.
         There'll be time enough for countin'
         (A)When the dealing's done.

Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep.
'Cause every hand's a winner,
And every hand's a loser,
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep."

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
And in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep
(Chorus) x2
