Red is the rose

Come (D) over the (Bm) hills, my (Em) bonnie Irish (G) lass (A) 
(D) Come over the (Bm) hills to your (G) darling (A)
(G) You choose the (Fm) rose, love, and (G) I'll make the (Bm) vow (A) 
And (D) I'll be your (Bm) true love (Em) for-(A)-ever. (D)
 
(Chorus) (D) Red is the (Bm) rose that in (Em) yonder garden (G) grows (A)
(D) Fair is the (Bm) lily of the (G) valley (A)
(G) Clear is the (Fm) water that (G) flows from the (Bm) Boyne (A)
(D) But my love is (Bm) fairer than (Em) any. (A) (D)
  
'Twas down by Killarney's green woods that we strayed
When the moon and the stars they were shining
The moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair
And she swore she'd be my love forever.
 
(Chorus)
 
It's not for the parting that my sister pains
It's not for the grief of my mother
'Tis all for the loss of my bonny Irish lass
That my heart is breaking forever.
 
(Chorus)
