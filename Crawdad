The Crawdad Song 

(C)You get a line and (F)I'll get a pole, (C)honey
You get a line and I'll get a pole, (G)babe
(C)You get a line and I'll get a pole
(F)We'll go fishin' in the crawdad hole
(C)Honey, (G)baby (C)mine

Sittin' on the bank 'til my feet get cold, honey
Sittin' on the bank 'til my feet get cold, babe
Sittin' on the bank 'til my feet get cold
Lookin' down that crawdad hole
Honey, baby mine

Yonder comes a man with a sack on his back, honey
Yonder comes a man with a sack on his back, babe
Yonder comes a man with a sack on his back
Packin' all the crawdads he can pack
Honey, baby mine

The man fell down and he broke that sack, honey
The man fell down and he broke that sack, babe
The man fell down and he broke that sack
See those crawdads backing back
Honey, baby mine

I heard the duck say to the drake, honey
I heard the duck say to the drake, babe
I heard the duck say to the drake
There ain't no crawdads in this lake
Honey, baby mine

(C)You get a line and (F)I'll get a pole, (C)honey
You get a line and I'll get a pole, (G)babe
(C)You get a line and I'll get a pole
(F)We'll go fishin' in the crawdad hole
(C)Honey, (G)baby (C)mine
