Walk on Boy 

I was born one mornin',
The rain a-pourin' down,
Heard my mammy say to my pappy,
"Let's call him John Henry Brown."

(Refrain) Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.

One day my pappy told me
Some advice I'd like to give to you
"Son, find a good woman, be good to her,
An' she's gonna be good to you."
(Refrain)
I left my mammy and pappy
Just about the age of ten;
Lord, I got me a job a-workin' on the levee
Totin' water for the hard workin' men.
(Refrain)
If anyone should ever ask you,
"Just who is that fella Brown?"
You can tell him I'm the boy
That left his hammer smokin'
Where he beat that ol' steam drill down.
(Refrain)
Walk on, boy.
