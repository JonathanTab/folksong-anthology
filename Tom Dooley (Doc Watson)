Tom Dooley (Doc Watson)

(G)Hang your head, Tom (C)Dooley,
Hang your head and (G)cry;
You (D)killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you (C)know you're bound to (G)die.
You left her by the (C)roadside
Where you begged to be (G)excused;
You (D)left her by the roadside,
Then you (C)hid her clothes and (G)shoes.

(Chorus) (G)Hang your head, Tom (C)Dooley,
         Hang your head and (G)cry;
         You (D)killed poor Laurie Foster,
         And you (C)know you're bound to (G)die.

You took her on the hillside
For to make her your wife;
You took her on the hillside,
And ther you took her life.

You dug the grave four feet long
And you dug it three feet deep;
You rolled the cold clay over her
And tromped it with your feet.
(Chorus)
"Trouble, oh it's trouble
A-rollin' through my breast;
As long as I'm a-livin', boys,
They ain't a-gonna let me rest.

I know they're gonna hang me,
Tomorrow I'll be dead,
Though I never even harmed a hair
On poor little Laurie's head."
(Chorus)
"In this world and one more
Then reckon where I'll be;
If is wasn't for Sheriff Grayson,
I'd be in Tennesee.

You can take down my old violin
And play it all you please.
For at this time tomorrow, boys,
Iit'll be of no use to me."
(Chorus)
"At this time tomorrow
Where do you reckon I'll be?
Away down yonder in the holler
Hangin' on a white oak tree.
(Chorus)
