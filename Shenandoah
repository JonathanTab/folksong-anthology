Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rollin' river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Away bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you
 
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
I'll take her across the open water

She said she could not be my lover
Because I was a dirty sailor

Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you
Oh Shenandoah, I'll not decieve you 

Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you
