Streets of London 

(C)Have you seen the (G)old man
In the (Am)closed-down (Em)market
(F)Kicking up the (C)paper
With his (Dm/D7)worn out (G)shoes?
(C)In his eyes you (G)see no pride
And (Am)held loosely at his (Em)side
(F)Yesterday's (C)paper telling (G)yesterday's (C)news

(Chorus) So (F)how can you (Em)tell me you're (C)lone(Am)ly
         And (D7)say for you that the sun don't (G)shine? (G7)
         (C)Let me take you (G)by the hand and
         (Am)Lead you through the (Em)streets of London
         (F)I will show you (C)something to (G)make you change your (C)mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags
(Chorus)
In the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour
And he wanders home alone
(Chorus) 
Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman's Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care
(Chorus)
