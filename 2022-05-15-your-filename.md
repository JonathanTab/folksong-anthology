WHISKEY IN THE JAR

As (D) I was going over the (Bm) Cork and Kerry mountains
I (G) met with captain Farrell and his (D) money he was (A) counting. 
I (D) first produced my pistol, and (Bm) then produced my rapier.
Said (G) stand and deliver, for ya (D) are a bold deceiver,
[Chorus] musha ring (A) dumma do damma da 
(D) whack for the daddy 'ol
(G) whack for the daddy 'ol
There's (D) whiskey (A) in the (D) jar

I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny.
She sighed and she swore, that she never would deceive me,
but the devil take the women, for they never can be easy
(Chorus)
I went into my chamber, a’ for to take a slumber,
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.
But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,
Then sent for captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter.
(Chorus)
It was early in the morning, as I rose up for travel,
The guards were all around me and likewise captain Farrel.
I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,
But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken.
(Chorus)
If anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army,
I think that he is stationed in Cork or in Killarney.
And if he'll go with me, we'll go roving near Kilkenny,
And I swear he'll treat me better than me darlin’ sportin’ Jenny
(Chorus)
Some take delight in the fishin’ and the trappin’,
But others take delight in the carriages a-rovin’.
But me I take delight in the juice of the barley,
And courting pretty women in the morning bright and early
(Chorus)
