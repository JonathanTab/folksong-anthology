I Saw the Light 

I wandered so aimless, life filed with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

(Refrain) I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man, I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
(Refrain) 
I was a fool to wander and stray
For straight is the gate and narrow's the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
(Refrain)
