Bonny light horseman 

(Chorus) (D)Oh, Napoleon (G)Bona(D)parte, you're the cause of my (A)woe
         Since my (G)bonny light horseman in the (A)war, he did go
         Broken-(D)hearted I'G)wan(D)der, broken-hearted I'll re(A)main
         Since my(G)bonny light horseman in the (A)war, he was (Bm)slain (A) (G)

(D)When Boney co(G)mman(A)ded his (D)armies to (A)stand
And (G)proud lift his banners all (A)gayly and grand
He (D)levelled his (G)can(A)nons right (D)over the (A)plain
And my (G)bonny light horseman in the (A)wars he was (Bm)slain (A) (G)
(Chorus)
And if I was some small bird and if I had wings to fly
I would fly over the ocean where my own true love does lie
I would fly over the ocean and alight upon the plain
Where my bonny light horseman in the war, he was slain
(Chorus)
And the white dove laments for her mate as she flies
"Tell me where in this wide world is my own true love," she cries
"And where in this wide world is there one who can compare
With my bonny light horseman who was slain in the war?"
(Chorus) x2
