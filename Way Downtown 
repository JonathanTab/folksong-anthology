It was late last night when Willie came home
I heard him a-rapping on the door
He's a-slipping and a-sliding with his new shoes on
Mamma said Willie don't you rap no more
(Refrain)
I wish I was over at my sweet Sally's house
Sittin' in that big armed chair
One arm around this old guitar
And the other one around my dear
(Refrain)
Now, its one old shirt is all that I got
And a dollar is all that I crave
I brought nothing with me into this old world
Ain't gonna take nothing to my grave
(Refrain)
