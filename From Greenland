From Greenland 

(C)The mist was hanging (Em)on the hill,
The (F)sun was still (C)deciding
The (F)old piper (C)called the (Am)tune
And (C)I was on my (F)way
(Dm/F)I called out your (C)name
So (F)loud you could have (C)heard me
And the (F)snow goose (C)flies in the (F)northern (G)sky
From (C)Greenland

Darkness comes with winter speed
They journey far from home
Always struggling to survive
Ever more to roam
They come back to Scotland
We’re brothers you and I
And the snow goose flies in the northern sky
From Greenland

Seize the day, for life is short
Live it while you can
I’ve never seen the highland hill
I didn’t want to climb
But I will stop to watch the cloud
That flies across the moon
And the snow goose flies in the northern sky
From Greenland
