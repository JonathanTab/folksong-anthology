Fiddler’s Green

As I (C)walked by the (F)dockside one (C)evening so (Am)fair
To (C)view the salt (F)waters and (C)take in the salt (G)air
I (F)heard an old fisherman (C)singing a song
Won’t you (G)take me away boys me (C)time is not (G)long

(Chorus) Wrap me (C)up in me (G)oilskin and (C)Jumper
No (F)more on the (C)docks I'll be (G)seen
Just (F)tell me old shipmates, I'm (C)taking a trip mates
And (G)I'll see you someday on (G7)Fiddlers (C)Green

Now Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell
Where the fishermen go if they don't go to hell
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play
And the cold coast of Greenland is far, far away
(Chorus) 
Yes the weather is fair and there's never a gail
And the fish jump on board with one swish on their tail
You can lie at your leisure, there's no work to do
And the skipper's below making tea for the crew
(Chorus)
When pull into port and the long trip is through
There's pubs and there's clubs and there's lassies there too
And the girls are all pretty and the beer is all free
And there's bottles of rum growing on every tree.
(Chorus)
Now I don't need a harp nor a halo, not me
Just give me a breeze and a good rolling sea
I'll play me old squeeze-box as we sail along
With the wind in the riggin to sing me a song
(Chorus)
