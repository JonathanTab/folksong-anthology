Annie Laurie
(G) Maxwellton braes are (C) bonnie, 
(G)Where early fa's the (D) dew, 
And 'twas (G) there that Annie (C) Laurie
Gave (G) me her (D) promise (G) true.
Gave me her (D7) promise (G) true, 
Which ne'er (D7) forgot will (G) be, 
And for (C) bonnie Annie (G) Laurie, 
I lay me (D) doon and (G) dee.
 
Her brow is like the snowdrift, 
Her neck is like a swan, 
Her face it is the fairest
That e'er the sun shone on.
That e'er the sun shone on, 
And dark blue is her ee, 
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I lay me doon and dee.
 
Like dew on th' gowan lying, 
Is the fa' o' her fairy feet, 
And like winds in summer sighing
Her voice is low and sweet.
Her voice is low and sweet, 
And she's a' the world to me, 
And for bonnie Annie Laurie, 
I lay me doon and dee.
