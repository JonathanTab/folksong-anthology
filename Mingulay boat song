Mingulay boat song 

(Chorus)
Hill you ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Bring her head round, now all together.
Hill you ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Sailing home, home to Mingulay.
(Chorus)
What care we though white the Minch is?
What care we for wind or weather?
Let her go, boys! ev'ry inch is
Wearing home, home to Mingulay.
(Chorus)
When the wind is wild with shouting
Adn the waves mount ever higher
Anxious eyes turn ever seaward
To see us home, boys, to Mingulay
(Chorus)
Wives are waiting on the bank, or
Looking seaward from the heather;
Pull her round, boys! and we'll anchor,
Ere the sun sets at Mingulay.
