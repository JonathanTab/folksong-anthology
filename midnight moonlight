Midnight Moonlight

(G) If you ever feel lonesome, (D) and youâ€™re down in San Antone 
(Am) Beg steal or borrow (D) two nickels or a (C) dime and call me on the (D) phone 
And I'll meet you at Alamo Mission where we can say our prayers 
And the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will heal us as we kneel there. 

(Chorus2x) In the (Am) moonlight (D) in the (Am) midnight (D)
In the (Am) moonlight (D) midnight moon-(G)-light. 

If you ever feel sorrow for things you might have done 
With no hope for tomorrow and the setting of the (D)sun 
And the ocean is howling of things that might have been 
And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever(C) seen. \

(Chorus)
