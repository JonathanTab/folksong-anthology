Sink the Bismarck

(D)In May of nineteen forty-one the (A)war had just begun(D)
The (G)Germans had the biggest ship, they (D)had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea
On her deck were guns as big as steers and (A)shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship, the Hood
And every British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

(Chorus) (D)We'll find the German battleship that's (A)makin' such a (D)fuss
We (D)gotta sink the Bismarck cause the (A)world depends on (D)us
(G)Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and (D)spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we (A)gotta cut her (D)down

The Hood found the Bismarck on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firin' fifteen miles away
"We gotta sink the Bismarck" was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away, the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people "put every ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea"
(Chorus)
The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made its run
The admiral of the British fleet said "turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down"

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismarck, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
"Sink the Bismarck" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship been makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
We found the mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down
