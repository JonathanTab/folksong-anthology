Come listen, all sweet charmers, come hear us rejoice
For nothing can compare to the plow-folk’s voice
There’s none that sing so merry as the farmers do in spring
When they hear the small birds whistle and the nightingales do sing.

(Chorus) When they hump along, jump along
Here, plies my blade along
Tuck and Tiger leading them on
Ruck and Ruby following along
Blubber and Fry now, hear me crying hoof along
We are the folk who can follow the plow
Oh we are the folk who can follow the plow.

We rise before the dawn, up before sun will shine
We rattle up our chains for to work we climb
The oxen teams we gather, for our work we all now how
Tie the oxen to the yolk, and the yolk to the plow
(Chorus)
If farmers have no corn no corn can they sow
And millers have no work for their mills also
And bakers has no bread for the poor to provide
If the plow should stand still we should all starve alive.
(Chorus)
And now to conclude this song must end
We know the plow-folk will all have friends
So health to the farmer, to the oxen in the stall
Here’s to health to the plow and to jolly plow-folk all.
(Chorus)
