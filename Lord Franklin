Lord Franklin

(C)It was homeward bound one night (Am)on the deep
(F)Swinging in my hammock I (G)fell asleep
I (C)dreamed a dream and I (F)thought it (C)true
Concerning (F)Franklin and his (G)gallant (C)crew
 
With one hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go
 
Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through
 
In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell
 
And now my burden it gives me pain
For my long lost Franklin I'd cross the main
Ten thousand pounds I would freely give
To say on earth that my Franklin do live
