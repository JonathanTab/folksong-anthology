Turning Towards the Morning

(G)When the deer has bedded down
And the (C)bear has gone to ground
And the (G)northern goose has wandered off
To warmer bay and (D)sound
It's so (G)easy in the cold to feel
The (C)darkness of the year
And the (G)heart is growing (D)lonely for the (C)morning(G)

(Chorus) Oh, my (D)Joanie, don't you know
That the (G)stars are swingin' slow
And the seas are rollin' easy
As they did so long (D)ago
If i (G)had a thing to give you
I would (C)tell you one more time
That the (G)world is always (D)turning toward the (C)morning(G)

When October's growin' thin
And November's comin' home
You'll be thinking of the seasons
And the sad things that you've seen
And you hear that old wind walkin'
Hear him singin' high and thin
You could swear he's out there singin' of your sorrow
(Chorus)
So the darkness falls around you
And you hear the north wind blow
And you hear him call your name out
As he walks the bitter snow
That old wind don't mean you trouble,
He don't care or even know
He's just walkin' down the darkness toward the morning
(Chorus)
It's a pity we don't know
What the little flowers know
They can't face the cold November
They can't take the bitter snow
They put their glories all behind them
Bow their heads and let it go
But you know they'll be there shining in the morning
(Chorus)
