Will the Circle Be Unbroken

(G)I was standing by the (G7)window
On one (C)cold and cloudy (G)day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my (D)mother (G)away

(Chorus) (G)Will the circle be unbroken
By and (C)by Lord, by and (G)by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, (D)in the (G)sky

I said to the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord I hate to see her go
(Chorus)
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
(Chorus)
I went back home, the home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone
(Chorus)
We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along
(Chorus)
