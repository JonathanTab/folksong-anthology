Wild colonial boy

There was a Wild Colonial Boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland, in a place called Castlemain
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love, the Wild Colonial Boy

At the early age of eighteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore, he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, to help the poor, he shot Judge McEvoy
A terror to Australia was, the Wild Colonial Boy

One morning on the prairie, as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mocking bird, singing a cheerful song
Up rode three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the Wild Colonial Boy

Surrender now, Jack Duggan, for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name, you are a plundering son
Jack drew two pistols from his belt and proudly waved them high
"I'll fight but not surrender, " said the Wild Colonial Boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning round to Davis, he received a mortal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart, from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the Wild Colonial Boy
