Gypsy Rover (Whistlin Gypsy)

The (G) gypsy rover came (C) over the (D) hill
(G) Down through the valley so (C) sha-(D)-dy
He (G) whistled and he (Am) sang till the (D) green woods (Em) rang
And (G) he won the (Am) heart of a (D) la-(G)-dy
 
(G) Ah dee do, ah dee (C) do da (D) day
(G) Ah dee do, ah dee (C) day (D) dee
He (G) whistled and he (Am) sang till the (D) green woods (Em) rang
And (G) he won the (Am) heart of a (D) la-(G)-dy
 
She left her father's castle gate
She left her own fond lover, left her servants
And estate
To follow the gypsy rover
(Chorus)
Her father saddled his fastest steed
Roamed these valleys all over
Sought his daughter at break neck speed
And the whistlin' gypsy rover
(Chorus)
he came at last to a mansion fine
Down by  the river Claydee
And there was music and there was wine
For the gypsy and his lady
(Chorus)
"He is no gypsy, my father", she said
But Lord of these lands all over
And I will stay till my dying day
With the whistlin' gypsy rover
