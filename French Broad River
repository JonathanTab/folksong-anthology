French Broad River

(C)Last morning I did tread the creek
(F)Thinking how my boots do leak
(C)‘Twas then that I was fain to speak
To (G)all you Naiads (C)dear.

(Chorus) Well I’ll (C)swim the french broad river
And (F)become a little thinner
When I (C)lay me down to dinner
At (G)Dixie’s house to dine.
Well (C)I’ll order in the brandy
And (F)wine and summer shandy
A (C)stronger braver man I’ll be
For (G)thee and me and mine.

A year ago today I sprung
From stone to rock aye every one
Amid the river wash and run
With my sweat-heart near.
The river-rocks did hold their fire
And with them my true love’s desire
And Johnny if you’ll be my squire
I’ll take you as my dear.
(Chorus)
But Janus meant to bind the lees
With a tether of ice about the knees
And when the river walk did freeze
My true love to me sang.
Last year I drank you down so wild
When you were cordial as a child
A tasty draft of bitter-and-mild
The glass it loudly rang.
(Chorus)
Had I the cocky red-breast song
To whistle Dixie all night long
For all the world that’s suffered wrong
And all you naiads dear.
