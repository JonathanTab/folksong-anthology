Jock Stewart 

(C) Now, my name is (G) Jock Stewart
I'm a (Am) canny gaun (F) man,
And a (C) roving young (G) fellow, I've (C) been.\

(Chorus) So be easy and free
When you're drinkin wi' me.
I'm a man you don't meet every day.

I have acres of land;
I have men at command;
I have always a shilling to spare.
(Chorus) 
Now, I took out my gun,
With my dog I did shoot,
All down by the River Kildare
(Chorus) 
I'm a piper by trade
And a roving young blade
And many a tune I do play
(Chorus) 
Let us catch well the hours
And the minutes that fly
And we'll share them together this day
(Chorus) 
So, come fill up your glasses
Of brandy and wine,
And whatever the cost, I will pay.
