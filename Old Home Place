The Old Home Place

(G)It's been ten long (B)years since (C)I left my (G)home
In the hollow where I was (D)born
Where the (G)cool fall (B)nights make the (C)wood smoke (G)rise
And the foxhunter (D)blows his (G)horn

I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill or two

(Chorus) (D)What have they done to the (G)old home place
         (A)Why did they tear it (D)down
         And (G)why did I (B)leave the (A)plow in the (G)field
         And look for a (D)job in the (G)town
         
Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away

Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I've lost my love I've lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead
(Chorus)
