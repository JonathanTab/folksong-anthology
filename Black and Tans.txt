BLACK AND TANS
I was (Bm) born in the Dublin street
Where the (A) loyal drums do beat,
And the (Bm) loving English feet walked all over us;
And (D) every single night when me (A) dad would come home tight,
He'd (Bm) invite the neighbours (A) out with this (Bm) chorus:

[Chorus] Come (Bm) out you black and tans,
Come out and (A) fight me like a man,
Show your (Bm) wife how you won medals down in Flanders;
Tell her (D) how the IRA made you (A) run like hell away,
From the (Bm) green and lovely (A) lanes of (Bm) Killeshandra.

Come tell us how you slew
Them ol' Arabs two by two,
Like the Zulus they had knives and bows and arrows;
Of how bravely you faced one with your sixteen-pounder gun,
And you frightened all the natives to the marrow.
(Chorus)
Come let us hear you tell
How you slammed the brave Parnell,
And taught him well and truly persecuted;
Where are the stares and jeers that you proudly let us hear,
When our heroes of sixteen were executed.
(Chorus)
Oh! Come out you British Huns,
Come out and fight without your guns,
Show your wife how you won medals up in Derry;
You murdered sixteen men and you'll do the same again,
So get out of here and take your bloody army.
(Chorus)
The day is coming fast 
And the time is here at last, 
When each yeoman will be cast aside before us, 
And if there be a need 
Sure my kids wil sing, "Godspeed!" 
With a verse or two of Steven Beehan's chorus.
(Chorus)
