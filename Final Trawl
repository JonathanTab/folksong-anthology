The Final Trawl

Now it's (D)three long years since we (A)made her (Bm)pay
(G)Haul away my (A)laddie (D)O
And the owners (Bm)say that she's (A)had her (G)day
Haul (Em)away my (G)laddie (A)O

So heave away for the final trawl
It's an easy pull for the catch is small

Then stow your gear, lads, and batten down
I'll tak the wheel an' I'll turn her 'round

We'll join the Venture and the Morning Star
Riding high and empty towards the bar

For I'd rather beach her on the Skerry rock
Than to see her torched in the breaker's dock

And when I die you can stow me down
In her rusty hold where the breakers pound

I'll make the haven of the Fiddler's Green
Where the grub is good, and the bunks are clean

For I've fished a lifetime, boy and man
And the final trawl scarcely makes a cran
