NEW YORK GIRLS
As (G) I walked down the (C) Broadway one (G) evening in (D) July
I (G) met a maid who (C) asked my trade – A (G) sailor (D) lad says (G) I
To Tiffany's I took her, I did not mind expense
An' I bought her two gold ear-rings, and they cost me fifty cents

(Chorus) And (G) away (C) Santy – (G) My dear (D) Annie
(G) O you (C) New York girls, (G) can't you (D) dance the (G) polka

Says she - You lime-juice sailor, now see me home you may
But when we reached her cottage door, she unto me did say
She says her man's a Yankee, with his hair cut short behind
And he wears a pair of tall sea boots and he sails in the Blackball Line

(Chorus)

He’s homeward bound this evening, and with me he will stay
So get a move on sailor boy, get cracking on your way!

(Chorus)

I kissed her hard and proper, before her yankee came
So fare ya well you Bowery girl, I know your little game.
 
(Chorus)

I wrapped me rags right round me and to the docks did steer.
I’ll never court another girl, I’ll stick to rum and beer

(Chorus)

I joined a yankee slug boat, we’re set to sail next morn,
Don’t ever mess with women boys, you’re safer round cape horn! 

(Chorus)
