A Little Bit More 

(G) When I was young me (C) father said,
It's (G) time the children (C) went to (D) bed,
(G) We would always (C) cry and roar,
I (G) want to stay up just a (D) little bit (G) more.
 
(Chorus) (G) A little bit more a (C) little bit more
(G) Not very much just a (C) little bit (D) more,
(G) A little bit more a (C) little bit more
(G) Not very much just a (D) little bit (G) more,

And when the morning came around,
You could hear that same auld sound
When they came rapping on the door
I want to lay on a little bit more.
(Chorus)
The barman says theres no more beer,
Drink up your drink and get out of here,
Still you see them hanging 'round the door,
Hopeing to get in for a little bit more.
(Chorus)
I met a girl called Mary Rose
I said young girl can I kiss your nose,
She said I met your likes before
All you want is a little bit more.
(Chorus)
And when your days are nearly done
Before you cross that rubicon
The doctor says your time is done,
And you pray to the Lord for a little bit more.
(Chorus)
