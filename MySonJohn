My son John (Cannonball)

(Em) My son John was (G) tall and (D) slim
And he (Em) had a leg for (G) every (D) limb
(Em) Now he's got no (D) legs at all
(Em) They’re both shot away by a (G) cannon (D) ball

(Chorus) (Em) Hoo-rum rye, (G/D) fadda riddle dye
(G) Whack fo' the diddle To me (G) hoo (D) rum (Em) rye

Well were ya drunk or were ya blind
To leave your two fine legs behind
Or was it from walkin upon the sea
That took your legs from the ground to the knee
(Chorus) 
Well I wasn’t drunk and I wasn’t blind
To leave my two fine legs behind
T’was a cannonball on the fifth o’ May
That took my legs from the ground to the knee
(Chorus) 
Each foreign war I'll now denounce
‘tween this King of England and that King of France
 I'd rather my legs as they used to be
Than the king of Spain and his whole navy
(Chorus) 
I was tall and I was slim
And I had a leg for every limb
But now I've got no legs at all
You can’t win a race with a cannon ball
