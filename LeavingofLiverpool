Leaving of Liverpool

Fare-(C)-well to you, my (F) own true (C) love,
I am going far, far a-(G)-way
I am (C) bound for Cali-(F)-forni-(C)-a,
And I know that I'll (G) return (C) someday

(Chorus) So (G) fare thee well, my (F) own true (C) love,
For when I return, united we will (G) be
It's not the (C) leaving of Liverpool that (F) grieves (C) me,
But my darling when I (G) think of (C) thee.

I have shipped on a Yankee sailing ship,
Davy Crockett is her name,
And Burgess is the Captain of her,
And they say that she's a floating hell
(Chorus)
Oh the sun is on the harbour, love,
And I wish that I could remain,
For I know that it will be a long, long time,
Before I see you again
(Chorus)
