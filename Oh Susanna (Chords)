Oh Susanna

Oh, I come from Alabama, with my banjo on my knee. I’m goin’ to Louisiana My true
love for to see. 

(Chorus) Oh! Susanna, now don’t you cry for me. For I come from
         Alabama, with my banjo on my knee.
         
It rained all night the day I left; The weather was so dry. The sun so hot I froze to death.
Susanna don’t you cry. 
(Chorus)
I had a dream the other night When everything was still; I thought I saw Susanna, A comin’ down the hill.
(Chorus)
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth; A tear was in her eye. I said, “I come from Dixie
Land; Susanna, don’t you cry!” 
(Chorus)
