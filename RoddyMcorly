Roddy McCorley
 
O see the fleet-foot host of men, who speed with faces drawn,
From farmstead and from fishers' hut, along the banks of Ban;
They come with vengeance in their eyes. Too late! Too late are they,
 
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
 
Up the narrow street he stepped, smiling, proud and young.
About the hemp-rope on his neck, the golden ringlets clung;
There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes, both glad and bright are they,
 
As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
today.
 
When he last stepped up that street, his shining pike in hand
Behind him marched, in grim array, a stalwart earnest band.
To Antrim town! To Antrim town, he led them to the fray,
 
As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
 
There's never a one of all your dead more bravely fell in fray
Than he who marches to his fate on the bridge of Toome today;
True to the last! True to the last, he treads the upwards way,
 
And young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
 
And young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
