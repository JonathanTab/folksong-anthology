Rare Old Mountain Dew

Let (D) grasses grow and (G) waters flow in a (D) free and easy (A) way
But (D) give me enough of the (G) rare old stuff that's (D) brewed near (A) Galway (D) Bay
Come policemen all from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim (Bm) too
Oh, we'll (D) give them the slip and we'll (G) take a sip
Of the (D) rare old (A) Mountain (D) Dew

(Chorus) Fi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh
Fi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still
Where the smoke curls up to the sky
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there's poitin' brewin' nearby
For it fills the air with a perfume rare
And betwixt both me and you
As home we stroll, we can take a bowl
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew
(Chorus)
Now learned men who use the pen
Have sung the praises high
Of the rare poitin' from Ireland green
Distilled from wheat and rye
Put away with your pills, it'll cure all ills
Be ye Pagan, Christian or Jew
So take off your coat and grease your throat
With the dear old Mountain Dew
