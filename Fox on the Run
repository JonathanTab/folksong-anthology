Fox on the Run 

(Chorus) She (G)walks through the (D)corn leading (Am)down to the (C)river
Her (Am)hair shone like (D)gold in the (C)hot morning (G)sun
She (G)took all the (D)love that a (Am)poor boy could (C)give her
And (Am)left me to (D)die like a (C)fox on the (G)run
Like a (C)fox, like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, on the (G)run

(C)Everybody (G)knows, the (D)reason for the (G)fall
When (C)woman tempted (G)man down in (A)paradise’s (D)hall
This (C)woman tempted (G)me, and (D)took me for a (G)ride
(C)Like the lonely (G)fox, I (D)need a place to(G)hide

Chorus

We’ll pour a glass of wine, to fortify our soul
We’ll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I see a string of girls, who’ll put me on the floor
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at my door
