Tennessee Stud 

Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would have made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

(Chorus) The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
         The color of the sun and his eyes were green
         He had the nerve and he had the blood
         There never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
         
Drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with the Spaniards bold
'Til I got me a skinful of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns, he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
(Chorus)
I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was riding on a Tennessee mare
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
A little horse colt playing 'round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare
(Chorus)
