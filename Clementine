Oh My Darling Clementine

(Chorus) Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine
(Chorus) 
Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine
(Chorus) 
Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine
(Chorus) 
Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine
(Chorus) 
How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine
(Chorus)
