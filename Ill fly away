Iâ€™ll Fly Away

(G)Some bright morning when this life is over
(C)I'll fly away
(G)To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll (D)fly (G)away

(Chorus) I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life have gone
Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly
(Chorus) 
Oh, how glad and happy when we meet
No more cold iron shackles on my feet
(Chorus) 
Just a few more weary days and then
To a land where joys will never end
