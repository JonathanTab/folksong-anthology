By The Mark

(G)When I cross over
I will (D)shout and sing
I will (G)know my Savior
By the (D)mark where the (C)nails have (G)been

(Chorus) (G)By the mark where the nails have been
By the (D)sign upon His precious skin
I will (G)know my Savior when I come to Him
By the (D)mark where the (C)nails have (G)been

A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the King of Heaven
Can be told from the prince of fools
(Chorus) 
On Calvary's Mountain
Where they made Him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago
(Chorus) 
I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been
