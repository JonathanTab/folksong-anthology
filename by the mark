By The Mark

When I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my Savior
By the mark where the nails have been

(Chorus) By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon His precious skin
I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been

A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the King of Heaven
Can be told from the prince of fools
(Chorus) 
On Calvary's Mountain
Where they made Him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago
(Chorus) 
I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been
