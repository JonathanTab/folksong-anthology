Annabelle 

(Am)Lease twenty acres (F)and one Ginny mule
(E)From the Alabama (Am)Trust
(Am)Half of the cotton, (F)third of the corn
(E)Get a handful of (Am)dust
 
(Chorus) (F)We cannot have all things to (C)please us
No (G)matter how we (Am)try
'Til we've (Am)all gone to (C)Jesus
We can (G)only wonder (Am)why
 
I had a daughter called her Annabelle
She's the apple of my eye
Tried to give her something like I never had
Didn't want to ever hear her cry
(Chorus)
When I'm dead and buried, I'll take a hard life of tears
Everyday I've ever known
Anna's in the churchyard, she's got no life at all
She's only got these words on a stone
(Chorus)
