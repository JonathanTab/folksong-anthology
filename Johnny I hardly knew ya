Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya

While (Em) goin' the road to sweet Athy, (Bm) hurroo, hurroo
While (Em) goin' the road to sweet Athy, (G) hurroo, hurroo
While goin' the road to (D) sweet Athy
A (Em) stick in me hand and a (Bm) drop in me eye
A (G) doleful (D) damsel (Em) I heard (Bm) cry,
(Em) Johnny I hardly knew ye.


(Chorus) With your (Em) drums and guns and guns and drums, (Bm) hurroo, hurroo
With your (Em) drums and guns and guns and drums, (G) hurroo, hurroo
With your drums and guns and (D) guns and drums  
The (Em) enemy nearly (Bm) slew ye
Oh my (G) darling (D) dear, Ye (Em) look so (Bm) queer
(Em) Johnny I hardly knew ye.

Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your eyes that were so mild
When my heart you so beguiled
Why did ye run from me and the child
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
(Chorus)
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your legs that used to run
When you went for to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
(Chorus)
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
I'm happy for to see ye home
All from the island of Sulloon
So low in flesh, so high in bone
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
(Chorus)
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
Ye'll have to put with a bowl out to beg
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
(Chorus)

They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
They're rolling out the guns again
But they never will take our sons again
No they never will take our sons again
Johnny I'm swearing to ye.
