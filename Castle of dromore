Castle of Dromore

(G)The October winds (C)lament
(G)around the (C)castle (Em)of (G)Dromore
Yet (C)peace is (Em)in her (Am)lofty (G)halls
My (C)loving (D)treasure (G)store

Though(C)Autumn leaves may droop and (G)die
a (C)bud of (D)spring are (G)you 
(Chorus) sing (Am)hush-a-by
(D)loo,la-(G)lo,la (Am)lan
sing (Am)hush-a-by (D)loo la (G)lo

Bring no ill will to hinder us
my helpless babe and me dread spirits
of the blackwater clan owen's wild banshee
and Holy Mary pitying us in Heaven
for grace doth sue sing hush-a-by
loo,la-lo,la lan sing hush-a-by loo la lo

Take time to thrive my ray of hope
in the garden of Dromore
Take heed young eaglet
till thy wings are feathered fit to soar
a little rest and then the world
is full of work to do
sing hush-a-by loo,
la-lo,la lan sing hush-a-by loo la lo
