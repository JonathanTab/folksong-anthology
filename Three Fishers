Three Fishers (Stan's chords) 

(Bm)Three fishers went sailing out (G)into the (A)west
Out (Bm)into the west as the (F#m)sun went (A)down
Each (G)thought on the woman that (D)loved him the (A)best, and
The (Bm)children stood watching them (G)out of the (A)town

(Chorus) For (D)men must work and (G)women must (A)weep
         For there's (Bm)little to earn and (F#m)many to (A)keep, and
         The (G)harbour bar be (Bm)moan(A)in', and
         The (Bm)harbour (G)bar be (A)moanin'(D)

Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower
They trimmed the lamps as the sun went down, and
They looked at the squall and they looked at the shower, and
The night-wrack came rollin' in, ragged and brown
(Chorus)
Three corpses lay out on the shining sand
In the morning gleam as the tide went down, and
The women were weepin' and wringin' their hands
For those who would never come back to the town
(Chorus)
Oh men must work and women must weep, and
The sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep, and
Good - bye to the bar and its moanin', and
Good - bye to the bar and it's moanin'
