The Foggy Dew
'Twas (Bm) down the glen one (A) Easter morn
To a (D) city (A) fair rode (Bm) I.
When (Bm) armed line of (A) marching men
In (D) squadrons (A) passed me (Bm) by.
No (D) pipes did hum, no (A) battle (Bm) drum
Did sound its (A) loud (Bm) tattoo
But the (Bm) Angelus bell o'er the (A) Liffey's swell
Rang (D) out in the (A/Fm) foggy (Bm) dew.

Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through;
While Brittania's huns with their great big guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.

'Twas England bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free.
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the fringe of the gray North Sea.
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha,
Their names we'd keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew.
The night fell black and the rifle crack
Made Perfidious Albion reel
Mid the leaden rain seven tongues of flame
Shone out o'er the line of steel
By each shining blade a prayer was said 
That to Ireland her sons be true
When the morning broke still the war flag shook
Out its folds in the foggy dew.

The bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide
In the springing of the year.
And the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.

And back through the glen 
I rode again and my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men
That I shall see no more
But to and fro in my dreams I’ll go
And I’ll kneel and pray for you
For slavery fled, O glorious Dead,
When you fell in the foggy dew!
