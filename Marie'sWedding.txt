Marie's Wedding
(Chorus) (G) Step we gaily on we go
(C) Heel for heel and (D) toe for toe
(G) Arm and arm and row and row
(C) All for Marie's (D) wedding
 
Over hillways, up and down
Myrtle green and bracken brown
Past the sheilings through the town
All for the sake of marie
(Refrain)
Red her cheeks as rowan's are
Bright her eyes as any star
Fairest of them all by far
Is our darlin' marie
(Refrain)
Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty peat to fill her kreel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Marie
(Refrain 2x)
