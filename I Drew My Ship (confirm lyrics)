I drew my ship 

(D)I will put my ship in order,
And I will set her on the (A)sea,
And I will (D)sail to yonder's (G)harbor,
To see if (G)my love (A)minds on (D)me.

I drew my ship into the harbor
I drew it up where my true love lay
I drew it close by into her window
To listen to what my love did say

"Who's there that knocks loud at my window?
Who knocks so loud and would come in?"
"It is your true love, who loves you dearly
Then rise love, and let me in"

So slowly, slowly got she up
And slowly, slowly came she down
But before she got the door unlocked
Her true love had both come and gone

He's brisk and broad, he's far away
He's far beyond the ranging main
Where bright eyes glancing and fishes dancing 
Have made him quite forget his own

I will put my ship in order,
And I will set her on the sea,
And I will sail to yonder's harbor,
To see if my love minds on me.
