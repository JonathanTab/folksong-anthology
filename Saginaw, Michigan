Saginaw, Michigan 

(C)I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew (F)up in a (C)house on Saginaw (G)Bay
My dad was a (C)poor, hard-working Saginaw (F)fisherman
Too many (C)times he came home (G)with too little (C)pay

I loved a girl 
In Saginaw, Michigan 
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand

Now I'm (F)up here in Alaska (C)looking around for gold
Like a (G)crazy fool I'm digging in this (C)frozen ground so cold
But with (F)each new day I pray I'll strike it (C)rich and then
I'll go back (G)home and claim my love in Saginaw, (C)Michigan

I wrote my love 
In Saginaw, Michigan 
I said honey I'm coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history

Her dad met me 
In Saginaw, Michigan 
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said son you wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?

Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw, Michigan

We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw, Michigan
