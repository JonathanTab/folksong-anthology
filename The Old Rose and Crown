The Old Rose and Crown

(D)Good friends gather (Bm)round and I'll (A)tell you a (G)tale
It's a (D)story well known to all lovers of (A)ale
For the (D)old English pub, once a (A)man's second (D)home
Has been (Bm)decked out by (G)brewers in (A)plastic and (G)chrome

(Chorus) Oh, (D)what has (Bm)become of the (A)old Rose and (G)Crown?
         The (D)Ship, the King's Arms, and the World Upside (A)Down
         For (D)oak, brass, and leather, and a (A)pint of the (D)best
         Fade (Bm)away like the (G)sun as it (A)sinks in the (D)west

The old oak and bar where the pump filled your glass
Gives way to Formica and tanks full of gas
And the landlord behind, once a man of good cheer
Now just mumbl–µs the price as he hands you your beer
(Chorus)
And where are the friends who would meet for a jar
And a good game of darts in the old public bar?
Well, the dartboard is gone, in its place is a thing
Where you pull on the handle and lose all your tin
(Chorus)
But the worst of it all's what they've done to the beer
Their shandies and lagers just make you feel queer
For an arm and a leg, they will fill up your glass
With a half and half mixture of ullage and gas
(Chorus)
So, come all you young people who like to sup ale
Lets hope for a happier end to my tale
For there's nothing can fill a man's heart with more cheer
Than to sit in a pub with a pint of good beer
(Chorus)
