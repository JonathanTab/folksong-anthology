The Boar's Head Carol 

The boar’s head in hand bring I,
Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary.
I pray you, my masters, be merry
Quot estis in convivio

(Chorus)Caput apri defero
Reddens laudes Domino

The boar's head, as I understand,
Is the rarest dish in all this land,
Which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland
Let us servire cantico.
(Chorus)
Our steward hath provided this
In honor of the King of Bliss;
Which, on this day to be served is
In Reginensi atrio
(Chorus)
