Well, the road was hot and flat as a ruler
Good hundred miles 'tween me and Missoula
That vinyl top wasn't gettin' no cooler
So I stopped at a quickie sack
'Cause I figured I'd need about a sixth of Miller
And one of those things so I wouldn't spill 'er
And I asked the girl if the beer was in the back
She said

(Chorus) "It's dry town
No beer, no liquor
For miles around"
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town

So I turned right around, no hesitation
Cursed the laws ruinin' the nation
Waved goodbye to the boy at the station
But she wouldn't go into gear
He said, "It sounds like your transmission
You need Bob, but he's gone fishin'
On his day off, he gets a long way from here"
'Cause...

[Chorus]

Well, back home, friends, you can get a dose of
Something strong from your local grocer
So I walked down 'til I come closer
To a place called Happy John's
He said, "I keep some for colds and fevers
Down under here's where I usually leave her
But just last night I felt a cold comin' on"

[Chorus]
