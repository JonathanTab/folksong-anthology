Killiecrankie

(G)Whaur hae ye been sae (C)braw, lad?
Whaur (G)hae ye been sae (D)brankie-o?
Whaur (G)hae ye been sae (C)braw, lad?
Come (G)'ye by (D)(C)Killiecrankie-o? (G)

(Chorus) An' (G)ye had been whaur (C)I hae been
         Ye (G)wadna been sae (D)cantie-o
         An' (G)ye had seen what (C)I hae seen
         On the (G)braes o' (D)(C)Killiecrankie-o (G)

I fought at land, I fought at sea
At hame I fought my auntie-o
But I met the Devil and Dundee
On the braes o' Killiecrankie-o
(Chorus)
The bauld pit cur fell in a furr
And Clavers gat a crankie-o
Or I had fed an Athol gled
On the braes o' Killiecrankie-o
(Chorus)
Oh fie, MacKay, What gart ye lie
I' the brush ayont the brankie-o?
Ye'd better kiss'd King Willie's lofe
Than come tae Killiecrankie-o
(Chorus)
It's nae shame, it's nae shame
It's nae shame to shank ye-o
There's sour slaes on Athol braes
And the de'ils at Killiecrankie-o
(Chorus)
