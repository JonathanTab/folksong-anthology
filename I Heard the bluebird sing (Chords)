I Heard The Bluebirds Sing

I met a girl down in the hills that gave my lonely heart a thrill
Her beauty seemed just like a breath of spring
And when I looked into her eyes I thought it blue as a summer skies
When I held her hand in mine I heard the bluebirds sing

They sang of wondering (Wondering if he loves her)
Will she marry (Marry if he asks her)
Will her heart be (Heart be true for him for) then and evermore
And when she's lonely (Lonely is he near her)
When there's sadness (Sadness will her cheer her)
Will they always (Always be together) until the day they part

I courted her for months on end until she promised we would wed
We planned on being married in the spring
All through the long cold winter months it seemed that spring would never come
And every gloomy winterday I heard the bluebirds sing

They sang of waiting (Waiting for the flowers)
And of counting (Counting every hour)
Till the bluebirds (Bluebirds chirps his welcome) to the world each morn
And while we're waiting (Waiting for the sunshine)
We keep hating (Hating every storm cloud)
That has gathered (Gathered o'er the mountains) to keep us for apart

And when at last spring touched the earth we were married in the church
Our wedding seems just like a dream come true
Though many years have come and gone our love is still as true and strong
As when I found longer ago and still the bluebirds sing

They sang of loving (Loving every hour) that I'm married (Married to my flower)
And we're happy (Happy ever after) as since the day we've met
And though we're older (Older love is sweeter) we grow fonder (Fonder of each other)
We'll be sweethearts (Sweethearts close together) until the day of time
