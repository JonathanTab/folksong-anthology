(Chorus) Oh Agnes, won't you go with me? We'll be married in style
         And we'll cross Lake Michigan, so blue and so wide
         We'll cross over Lake Michigan, 'til we come to the shore
         And our orchards will blossom for our babies as they're born
         
Oh yes, love I will go with you, leave Wisconsin behind
Though my parents think little of my life on a farm
For to leave the gay city life, and be married on a farm
But I'll watch the orchards bloom in spring
Spend the winter's warm in your arms
(Chorus)
Three children she gave to him, Curtis, Addie and Dee
And their fourth child little Gussie came, ten years after these
And she raised them with loving hand and with firmness of mind
And she raised them through troubled times, Agnes strong
Willed and kind
(Chorus)
Now three score years have gone and past, like the fruit on the trees
And your children have children with babes on their knees
And they all join in the summertime, by the crystal lake shore
To greet lovely Agnes, now 12 years and four-score
(Chorus)
