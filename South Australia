South Australia

In South Australia I was born, heave away, haul away
In South Australia, 'round Cape Horn, we're bound for South Australia

(Chorus) Haul away your rolling kings, heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing, we're bound for South Australia

As I walked out one morning fair, heave away, haul away
'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair, we're bound for South Australia
(Chorus)
There's just one thing that's on my mind, heave away, haul away
That's leaving Nancy Blair behind, we're bound for South Australia
(Chorus)
And as we wallop around Cape Horn, heave away, haul away
You'll wish to God you've never been born, we're bound for South Australia
(Chorus)
In South Australia I was born, heave away, haul away
In South Australia, 'round Cape Horn, we're bound for South Australia
