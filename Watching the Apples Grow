Watching the Apples Grow 

(C)It's early up, Ontario (F)farm
(C)Chicken crow for (Am)day
I (F)wish I grew (C)Annapolis apples
Up above Fundy's (Am)Bay
(F)Oh, it (C)seems so (G)(C)far away

On the ridge above Acadia's town
To the valley down below
The evening shadow falls upon the families
Listening to the radio
And watching the apples grow

(Chorus) (F)Down on the farm
         (C)Back among the family
         (F)Away from (C)Ontario
         (F)Hear the ladies (C)singing to the men
         Dancing in the heel and (Am)toe
         (F)And (C)watching the (G)apples (C)grow

Ontario, you know I've seen
A place I'd rather be
Your scummy lakes and your city of Toronto
Don't do a damn thing for me
I'd rather live by the sea

I'd watch the V's of geese go by
The foxfoot in the snow
I'd climb the ridge of Gaspereau Mountain
Look into the valley below
And watching the apples grow
(Chorus) x2
