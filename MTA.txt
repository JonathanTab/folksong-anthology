Charlie on the M.T.A.

Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charley on a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family, went to ride on the M.T.A.

Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown
(What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square Station and he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there the conductor told him, "One more nickel." Charlie couldn't get off of that train

Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown
(What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned

Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station, crying, "What will become of me?!
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea or my cousin in Rocksbury?"

Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown
(What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned

Charlie's wife goes down to the Sculley Square Station every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin' through

Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown
(What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned

Now, you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal how the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase! Vote for George O'Brien! Get poor Charlie off the M.T.A.

Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown
(What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned

He's the man who never returned. He's the man who never returned
E tu, Charlie?
