Courtin in the Kitchen

(D) Come single belle and beau, unto me pay (A) attention
(D) Don't ever fall in love, it's the (G) devil's own (A) invention
(D) Once I fell in love with a maiden so bewitchin'
Miss (G) Henrietta Bell out of (Em) Captain Kelly's (A) Kitchen7

(Chorus) With my (D) tooral-ooral-I, and my tooral-ooral-(G) addy
With my (D) tooral-ooral-I, and my (G) tooral-(A) ooral- (D) addy


At the age of seventeen, I was 'prenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green, where Miss Henry used to go sir
Her manners were sublime and she set my heart a-twitchin'
And she invited me to a hooley in the kitchen
(Chorus)
Next Sunday being the day, we were to have the "flare-up"
I dressed myself quite gay and I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The captain had no wife, faith he had gone out fishin'
And we kicked up high life down below stairs in the kitchen
(Chorus)
Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table
She handed tay and cake and I ate while I was able
I drank hot punch and tay till me side had got to stitchin'
And the hours passed quick away when you're courtin in the kitchen
(Chorus)
With her arms around my waist, she slyly hinted marriage
To the door in dreadful haste, came Captain Kelly's carriage
Her eyes soon filled with hate and poison she was spittin'
When the captain at the door, walked right into the kitchen
(Chorus)
She flew up off me knees full five feet up or higher
And over head and heels through me slap into the fire
Me new repealer's coat that I bought from Mr. Mitchell
With a twenty shilling note went to blazes in the kitchen... 
(Chorus)
I grieved to see me duds all smeared with soot and ashes
When a tub of dirty suds right in me face she dashes
As I lay on the floor the water she kept pitchin'
The footman broke the door and walked straight into the kitchen
(Chorus)
When the captain came downstairs, though he saw my situation
In spite of all my prayers, I was marched off to the station
For me they'd take no bail, but to get home I was itchin'
And I had to tell the tale how I came into the kitchen
(Chorus)
I said she did invite me, but she gave a flat denial
For assault, she did indict me and I was sent for trial
She swore I robbed the house in spite of all her screechin'
And I got six months "hard" for my courtin in the kitchen
(Chorus)
