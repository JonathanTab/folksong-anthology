Faded roses of December 

(E)The faded roses of December
Are (A)sweeter than the flowers of the (E)spring.
I'd (B)rather have a heartache to (E)remember
Than a (F#)fickle love that doesn't mean a (B)thing.
No (E)matter what it is they say about me,
That (A)I'm sad and will give no reason (G#7)why,
It's (A)because my faded rose (E)within my heart still (C#m)grows
While the (F#)flowers of the (B)springtime fade and (E)die.

Today will soon become tomorrow.
Oh, how I wish my heart could stay behind!
For though I know the past just brings me sorrow,
To love again would only be unkind.
Don't ask me for a heart that I can't give you
Or to live as though the past had never been,
For the vows I make today my dreams would all betray
And then my faded rose would bloom again.

The faded roses of December
Are sweeter than the flowers of the spring.
I'd rather have a heartache to remember
Than a fickle love that doesn't mean a thing.
No matter what it is they say about me,
That I'm sad and will give no reason why,
It's because my faded rose within my heart still grows
While the flowers of the springtime fade and die.
