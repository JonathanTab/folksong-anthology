Tall Buildings 

(D)Someday, my (A)baby, when (Bm)I am a (D)man
And (G)others have taught me the (A)best that they can
They'll (D)sell me a (A)suit then (Bm)cut off my (D)hair
And (G)send me to (A)work in tall (D)buildings

(Chorus) So it's (D)goodbye to the (A)sunshine
         Good(Bm)bye to the (D)dew
         (G)Goodbye to the flowers
         And (A)goodbye to you
         I'm (D)off to the (A)subway
         I (Bm)must not be (D)late
         I'm (G)going to (A)work in tall (D)buildings
         
Oh when I retire
My life is my own
I made all the payments
It's time to go home
And wonder what happened
Betwixt and between
When I went to work in tall buildings
(Chorus) x2
