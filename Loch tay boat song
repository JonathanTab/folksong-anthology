Loch Tay Boat Song

(G)When I've done my work of (Bm)day, 
And I (C)row my (D)boat (G)away, 
Doon the (C)waters of Loch (G)Tay,(Em) 
As the (G)evening (D)light is (C)fading(G)
And I look upon Ben Lawers 
Where the after glory glows; 
And I think on two bright eyes 
And the melting hours below.
 
She's my (G)beauteous (C)nighean (G)ruadh, 
She's my (G)joy and (C)sorrow too;(G)
And (C)although she is un(G)true,(Em)
Well I (G)cannot (D)live with(C)out (G)her, 
For my heart's a boat in tow, 
And I'd give the world to know 
Why she means to let me go, 
As I sing horee horo.
 
Nighean ruadh, your lovely hair 
Has more glamour I declare 
Than all the tresses rare 
'tween Killin and Aberfeldy. 
Be they lint white, brown or gold, 
Be they blacker than the sloe, 
They are worth no more to me 
Than the melting flake of snow.
Her eyes are like the gleam 
O' the sunlight on the stream; 
And the songs the fairies sing 
Seem like songs she sings at milking. 
But my heart is full of woe, 
For last night she bade me go 
And the tears begin to flow, 
As I sing horee, horo.
