Roseville Fair

(C) Oh, the night was clear and the (F) stars were (C) shinin'
and the moon came (G) up, so quiet in the (C) sky
And all the people gathered round while the band was a-tunin'
I can hear them now playin' 'Comin' Through the Rye'

You were dressed in blue and you looked so lovely
just a gentle flower of a small town girl
Then you took my hand and we stepped to the music
with a single smile you became my world

(Chorus) And we danced all (F) night, to the fiddle and the (C) banjo (G)
And their driftin' (F) tunes (G) seemed to fill the (C) air
so long ago, but I still remember ...
when we fell in love, at the Roseville Fair

Now, we courted well, and we courted dearly
And we'd rock for hours on the front porch chair
Then a year went by ... from the time that I met you
When I made you mine, at the Roseville Fair
(Chorus)
So here's a song for all of the lovers
and here's a tune that you can share
May you dance all night to the fiddle and the banjo
Oh, the way we did at the Roseville Fair
