Make and break harbor 

(D)How still lies the (Bm)bay in the (G)light western (A)airs
Which (Em)blow from the (G)crimson (A)horizon; (A7)
Once (D)more we tack (D7)home with a (G)dry empty (A)hold
Saving (Em)gas with the (G)breezes so (A)fair
She's a (D)kindly Cape (Bm)Islander, (G)old but still (A)sound
But so (Em)lost in the (G)longliner's (A)shadow;(A7)
Make and (D)break and make (D7)do, but the (G)fish are so (Em)few
That she (A)won't be (G)replaced should she (D)founder

Now it's so hard to not think of before the big war
When the cod went so cheap, but so plenty;
Foreign trawlers go by now with long seeking eyes
Taking all where we seldom take any
And the young folk don't stay with the fisherman's ways
Long ago they all moved to the cities;
And the ones left behind, old and tired and blind
Won't work for a pound, for a penny

(Chorus) (G)In Make And Break (A)Harbour the (D)boats are so few
         Too (Bm)many are (A)pulled up and (G)rotten; (A)
         Most (D)houses stand (Bm)empty, old (D)nets hung to (G)dry
         Are (A)blown away, (G)lost and (D)forgotten

Now I can see the big draggers have stirred up the bay
Leaving lobster traps smashed on the bottom;
Can they think it don't pay to respect the old ways
That Make And Break men have not forgotten
For we still keep our time to the turn of the tide
In this boat that I built with my father;
Still lifts to the sky, the one-lunger and I
Still talk like old friends on the water
(Chorus) x2
