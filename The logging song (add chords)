The logging song

It's early in the morning
When the birds sing in the pines
The sun peeks through the forest
Where the cold river climbs
The men are up at five o'clock
And to the trees at six
A hard day's work, a good night's sleep
Is all they ever mix

(Chorus) Way, hey
Another brand-new day
On the wild and windy shores
Of old super-i-ay

From North Bay to Fort William
On the rocky northern shore
The mills are filled with cedar pulp
And the boats are filled with ore
I worked in a logging camp
My daddy did before
We're calloused hands and weathered skin
And iron to the core
(Chorus)
Now the flies are thick and the men get sick
It's as cold as it can be
And nothing's unexpected
In the north coun-ter-y
When the summer ends and the winter comes
It's forty-two below
We settle down in plywood shacks
And cover up with snow
(Chorus)
Now, when I die I will have seen
The wonders of the sea
And I will have climbed the mountains
In the western coun-ter-y
But most of all I won't forget
The wild and wondrous thing
The falling of the timber
When it's early in the spring
(Chorus)x2
