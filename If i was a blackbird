If I was a Blackbird

I am a young sailor, my story is sad,
Though once I was carefree and a brave sailor lad,
I courted a lassie by night and by day,
Oh but now she has left me, 
And sailed far away.

(Chorus) Oh, if I was a blackbird could whistle and sing,
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in,
And in the top riggin' I would there build my nest,
And I'd flutter my wings o'er her lilly white breast.

Or if I was a scholar and could handle the pen
Once secret love letter to my true love I'd send
And tell of my sorrow, my grief and my pain
Since she's gone and left me 
In yon flowery glen.
(Chorus)
I sailed o'er the ocean, my fortune to seek
Though I missed her caress and her kiss on my cheek
I returned and I told her my love was still warm
but she turned away lightly 
And great was her scorn. 
(Chorus)
I offered to take her to Donnybrook Fair
And to buy her fine ribbons to tie up her hair
I offered to marry and to stay by her side
But she says in the morning 
She sails with the tide.
(Chorus)
My parents, they chide me, oh they will not agree
Saying that me and my false love, married should never be
Oh but let them deprive me, or let them do what they will
While there's breath in my body
She's the one that I love still
(Chorus)
