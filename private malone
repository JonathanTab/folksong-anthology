Riding With Private Malone

(G)I was just out of the service thumbin' through the classifieds
When an (C)ad that said old Chevy somehow caught my eye
(G)The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I (C)had that thousand (D)dollars in my (G)hand
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp
When I pulled the cover off it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
What a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote
 
My (G)name is (D)Private (C)Andrew (D)Malone
If (G)youâ€™re reading (D)this then I (C)didn't make it (D)home
But for (G)every dream that's (D)shattered another(C) one comes (D)true
This (C)car was once a dream of mine, (D)now it belongs to you
And (G)though you may (D)take her and (C)make her your (D)own
(G)You'll always be (D)riding(C) with (D)Private (G)Malone
 
It didn't take me long at all I had her runnin' good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shinin' like a diamond and I'd put the rag top down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldies show especially late at night
I'd get the feelin' sometimes if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier riding shotgun in the seat right next to me
 
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered there's another that comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And he told me to take her and make her my own
(Repeat intro.)
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone
 
One night it was raining hard I took a curve too fast
I still don't remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name but I know without a doubt
 
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that shatters there's another that comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
(Repeat intro.)
Yeah that night I was riding with Private Malone
(Repeat intro.)
Oh thank God I was riding with Private Malone
Private Malone....
