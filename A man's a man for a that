A Man’s A Man For A’ That

Is there for honest poverty 
That hings his heed and a' that 
The coward slave we pass him by 
We dare be poor for a' that 
For a' that and a' that 
Our toils obscure and a' that 
The rank is but the guinea's stamp 
The mands the gowd for a' that 

What tho' on hamely fare we dine 
Wear hoddin-gray and a' that 
Gie fools their silks and knaves their wine 
A mands a man for a' that 
For a' that and a' that 
Their tinsel show and a' that 
The honest man tho' e'er sae poor 
Is king o' men for a' that 

Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord 
Wha struts and stares and a' that 
Tho' hundreds worship at his word 
He's but a coof for a' that 
For a' that and a' that 
His riband, star and a' that 
The man o' independent mind 
He looks and laughs at a' that 

A prince can mak a belted knight 
A marquis, duke and a' that 
But an honest mands aboon his might 
Guid faith he mauna fa' that 
For a' that and a' that 
Their dignities and a' that 
The pith o' sense and pride o' worth 
Are higher rank than a' that 

Then let us pray that come it may 
As come it will and a' that 
That sense and worth o'er a' the earth 
Shall bear the gree and a' that 
For a' that and a' that 
It's coming yet for a' that 
That man to man the warld o'er 
Shall brothers be for a' that 
For a' that and a' that 
It's coming yet for a' that 
That man to man the warld o'er 
Shall brothers be for a' that
