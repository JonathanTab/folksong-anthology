Little Annie

(C)Once more I must (F)leave you little Annie
We must (C)part at the end of the (G)lane
But you (C)promised me little (F)Annie
You’d be (C)waiting when the (G)springtime comes (C)again

(Chorus) When the (G)springtime comes o’er the (C)mountains
         And the wild flowers scatter o’er the (G)plains
         I will (C)watch for the leaves to (F)return to the trees
         And I’ll be (G)waiting when the springtime comes (C)again

When the sun shines down on the mountains
And the wild sheep are wandering all alone
And the birds and the bees are singing
Then it makes me think that springtime won’t be long
(Chorus) 
Now the springtime has come on the mountains
And I’m on my way back to the lane
For you promised me little Annie
You’d be waiting when the springtime comes again
