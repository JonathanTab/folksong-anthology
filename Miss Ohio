(F)Oh me oh (C)my oh
(G)Look at Miss (Am)Ohio(G)
She’s a (F)running around with her (C)rag-top (G)down
She says I (F)wanna do right but (C)not right (G)now

Gonna drive to Atlanta
And live out this fantasy
Running around with the rag-top down
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
An' mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah, you wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She’s a runnin’ around with the rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

I know all about it, so you don’t have to shout it
I’m gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a runnin’ around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right , but not right now
Oh, I want do right but not right now
