The Devilâ€™s Courtship

"I'll buy you a pennyworth o' priens
If that be the way true love begins
If ye'll gang alang wi' me m'dear, if ye'll gang alang wi' me?"

"Ye can hae your pennyworth of priens
Though that be the way true love begins
For I'll never gang wi' you m'dear, I'll never gang wi' you."

"I'll buy you a braw snuff box
Nine times opened, nine times locked
If ye'll gang alang wi' me m'dear, if ye'll gang alang wi' me?"

"You can hae your braw snuff box
Nine times opened, nine times locked
For I'll never gang wi' you m'dear, I'll never gang wi' you."

"I'll buy you a silken goon
Wi' nine stripes up and nine stripes doon
If ye'll gang alang wi' me m'dear, if ye'll gang alang wi' me?"

"You can hae your silken goon
Wi' nine stripes up and nine stripes doon
For I'll never gang wi' you m'dear, I'll never gang wi' you."

"I'll buy you a nine stringed bell
Tae call yer maid when'er you will
If ye'll gang alang wi' me m'dear, if ye'll gang alang wi' me?"

"You can keep your nine stringed bell
Tae call my maid when'er I will
For I'll never gang wi' you m'dear, I'll never gang wi' you."

"I'll gie you a kist o' gold
Tae comfort you when you are old
If ye'll gang alang wi' me m'dear, if ye'll gang alang wi' me?"

"These are fine words you say
So mount up lad you've won the day
I'll gang alang wi' you m'dear, I'll gang alang wi' you."

They'd scarcely gone a mile
Before she spied his cloven heel
"I rue I come wi' you" she says, "I rue I come wi' you."

"I'll grip ye hard and fast, 
Gold won your virgin heart at last
And I'll no part wi' you m'dear, I'll never part wi' you."

And as they were galloping along
The cold wind carried her mournful song
"I rue I come wi' you" she says, "I rue I come wi' you."
"I rue I come wi' you" she says, "I rue I come wi' you."
