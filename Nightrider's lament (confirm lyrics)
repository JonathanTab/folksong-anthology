Night rider's lament 

(C)One night while I was out a (F)ridin'
The (C)grave yard shift, midnight 'til (G)dawn
The (F)moon was bright as a (C)readin' (Am)light
For a (F)letter from an (G)old friend back (C)home
And he asked me
(Chorus) (F)Why do you (G)ride for your (C)money
         Tell me (F)why do you (G)rope for short (C)pay
         You ain't a'(F)gettin' (G)nowhere
         And you're (C)losin' your (F)share (Dm)
         Boy, you (G)must have gone crazy out (C)there

He said last night I ran on to Jenny
She's married and has a good life
And boy you sure missed the track
When you never come back
She's the perfect professional's wife
And she asked me
(Chorus)
(Bridge) Ah but they've (F)never (G)seen the (C)Northern Lights
         They've (F)never seen a (G)hawk on the (C)wing
         They've (F)never spent (G)spring on the (C)Great (F)Divide(Dm)
         And they've (G)never heard ole' camp cookie (C)sing

Well I read up the last of my letter
And I tore off the stamp for black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and grinned
He said now
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
