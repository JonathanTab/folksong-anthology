Loch Lomond 

By (D)yon bonnie (Bm)banks
And by (Em)yon bonnie (G)braes(A)
Where the (D)sun shines (Bm)bright on Loch (G)Lomond(A)
Where (G)me and my (Fm)true love
Were (G)ever want to (Bm)gae(A)
On the (D)bonnie, bonnie (Bm)banks of Loch (Em)Lomond(A) (D)

(Refrain) Oh! (D)ye'll take the (Bm)high road and
(Em)I'll take the (G)low (A)road
And (D)I'll be in (Bm)Scotland a(G)fore (A)ye;
But (G)me and my (Fm)true love
Will (G)never meet (Bm)again(A)
On the (D)bonnie, bonnie (Bm)banks of Loch (Em)Lomond(A) (D)

'Twas there that we parted
In yon shady glen
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond
Where in purple hue
The Highland hills we view
And the moon rising out oâ€™er the gloamin
(Refrain)
The wee birdies sing
And the wild flowers spring
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping
But the broken heart it kens
Nae second Spring again
Tho' the waeful may cease frae their greeting
(Refrain)
