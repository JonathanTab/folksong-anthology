Roarin` Mary

(D)You’re a bear in a sheepskin coat 
And (G)O’Donnell caught you on the (D)boat 
And three little piggies on Walkin street 
Have (A)gobbled up all your corn to eat. 

With a (D)too-ra-loo-ra-(G)loo-rae-ay 
(A)Whack fol da diddle loora-da-o-(D)may. 

Now Buckeye jim has lost his way 
Saving his corn for a rainy day 
And North Country beagles have run awry 
With a Billy O’Neil just a-wonderin’ why. 

Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-rae-ay 
Whack fol da diddle loora-da-o-may.

I lost three dimes on a horse called Stewball, 
By a dozen lusty mares was called 
And when they got him back to his stable 
Owner says I hope to God you’re able. 

(Chorus)

Had a girl by the banks of the Ohio 
Suckled by wind and rain and snow 
No honest man on earth could keep her 
So she ran off with a Scottish preacher.

(Chorus)

I had a girl called Roarin’ Mary 
And with her I am feign to dally 
No hope left on that blind man’s table 
I’ll settle down with a cock-right fable. 

(Chorus)
