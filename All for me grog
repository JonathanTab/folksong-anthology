All For Me Grog

(Chorus) And it's (G) all for me grog, me (C) jolly jolly (G) grog
All for me beer and (D7) tobacco
Well I've (G) spent all me tin with the (C) lassies drinking
(G) Gin
Far across the western (D) ocean I must (D7-G) wander

I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed
Since first I came ashore with me plunder
I've seen centipedes and snakes
And my head is full off aches
And I'll have to make a path for way out yonder
(Chorus) 
Where are me boots, me noggin' noggin' boots
They're all sold for beer and tobacco
You see the sole's were gettin' thin
And the uppers were letting in
And the heels are looking out for better weather
(Chorus) 
Where is me shirt me noggin' noggin' shirt
It's all gone for beer and tobacco
You see the sleeves they got worn out
And the collar was turned about
And the tail is looking out for better weather
(Chorus) 
Where is me wife me noggin' noggin' wife
She's all sold for beer and tobacco
You see her front it got worn out
And her tail been kicked about
And I'm sure she's looking out for better weather
(Chorus) 
Oh, where is me bed me noggin' noggin' bed
It's all sold for beer and tobacco
You see I sold it to the girls
And the springs they got all twirls
And the sheets they're looking out for better weather
(Chorus)
