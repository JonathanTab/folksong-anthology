Carrickfergus
(G) I wish I (Am) was (D) in Carrick(G)fergus
Only for (Am) nights (D) in Bally(G)grand
I would swim (Am) over (D) the deepest (G) ocean
Only for (Am) nights (D) in Bally(G)grand
But the sea is (Em) wide and I cannot swim (D) over
And neither have (Em) I the (Am) wings to (D) fly
(G) I wish I (Am) had (D) a handsome (G) boatsman
To ferry me (Am) over (D) my love and I (G)

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times there spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all past on now with the melting snow
So I'll spend my days in this endless roving
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
Oh to be home now in carrickfergus
On the long rode down to the salty sea

Now in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now til I get a drink
Cause I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober
A handsome rover from town to town
Ah but I'm sick now my days are numbered
Come all me young lads and lay me down.
