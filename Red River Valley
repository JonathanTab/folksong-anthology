(D)From this valley they say you are goin'
I will miss your bright eyes and sweet (A)smile
For they (D)say you are takin' the (G)sunshine
That has (A)brightened our pathway (D)awhile

(CHORUS) (D)Come and sit by my side if you love me,
         do not hasten to bid me (A)adieu,
         but (D)remember the Red River (G)Valley, 
         and the (A)cowboy that loves you so (D)true. 

Do you think of the valley you're leavin'
Oh how lonely and drear it will be
Do you think of the fond heart you're breakin'
And the pain you are causing to me

For a long time my dear, I've been waiting
For the sweet words you never would say
And at last all my fond hopes have vanished
For they say you are goin' away

As you go to your home by the ocean
May you never forget those sweet hours
That we spent in the Red River Valley
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers
