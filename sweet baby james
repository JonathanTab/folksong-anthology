Sweet Baby James

(D)There is a young (A)cowboy, he (G)lives on the (F#m)range
His (Bm)horse and his (G)cattle are his (D)only (F#m)companions
He (Bm)works in the (G)saddle and (D)sleeps in the (F#m)canyons
(G)Waiting for (D)summer, his (A)pastures to (Em)change(A)
And (G)as the moon rises he (A)sits by his (D)fire
(Bm)Thinking about (G)women and (D)glasses of (A)beer
And (G)closing his eyes as the (A)dogies (D)retire
He (Bm)sings out a (G)song which is (D)soft but it's clear
As (Esus7)if maybe (Em)someone could (Asus7)hear(A)

(D)Goodnight you (G)moonlight (A)ladies(D)
(Bm)Rockabye (G)sweet baby (D)James
(Bm)Deep greens and (G)blues are the (D)colors I choose
Won't you (Esus7)let me go (E)down in my (Asus7)dreams(A)
And (G)rockabye (A)sweet baby (D)James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Though the Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway,
A song that they sing when the take to the sea,
A song that they sing of their home in that sky.
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep,
But singing works just fine for me.
