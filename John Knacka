John Knacka 
I thought I heard the first mate say
John Kanaka-naka too rie ay
Today, today is a holiday
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay                       
 
(Chorus) Too rie ay, oh, to lie ay
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
 
We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay
We're bound away at the break of day
(Chorus)
We’re a yankee ship with a yankee crew
And we’re the boys to beat her through
(Chorus)
So heave away and haul away
Oh heave away and earn your pay
(Chorus)
Flectamus genua
Levate
(Chorus)
