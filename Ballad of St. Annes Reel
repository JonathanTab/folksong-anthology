The Ballad of St. Anne’s Reel

He was stranded in a tiny town on fair Prince Edward Island 
Waiting for a ship to come and find him 
A one horse place, a friendly face, some coffee, and a tiny trace 
Of fiddling in the distance far behind him. 

And a dime across the counter then, a shy hello, a brand new friend 
A walk along the street in the wintry weather 
A yellow light, an open door, and a welcome friend there's room for more 
And then they're standing there inside together. 

He said I've heard that tune before somewhere but I can't remember when 
Was it on some other friendly shore, did I hear it in the wind 
Was it written on the sky above, I think I heard it from someone I love 
But I never heard it sound so sweet since then. 

And now his feet begin to tap and a little boy says I'll take your cap 
And he spun off in the magic of her smile 
And leaped the heart within him went when off across the floor he sent
His clumsy body graceful as a child. 

He said there's magic in the fiddlers and there's magic in this town 
There's magic in the dancers' feet and the way they put them down 
People smiling everywhere, boots and fiddles, locks of hair, 
And laughter oh blue suits and Easter gowns. 

The sailor's gone, the room is bare, the old piano's sitting there 
Someone's hat's left hanging on the rack 
The empty chairs, the wooden floor that feels the touch of shoes no more 
A-waiting for the dancers to come back. 

And the fiddle's in the closet of some daughter of the town 
The strings are broke, the bow is gone, and the cover’s buttoned down
But sometimes on December nights when the air is cold and the wind is right 
There's a melody that passes through the town.
