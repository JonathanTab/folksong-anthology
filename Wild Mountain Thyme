Wild Mountain Thyme

Oh the (D) summer (A) time is (D) comin'
And the (G) trees are sweetly (D) bloomin'
And the (G) wild (D) mountain (Bm) thyme
Grows (Em) around the bloomin' (G) heather
Will you (D) go, (G) lassie, (D) go?

And we'll (G) all go (D) together
To pluck (G) wild (D) mountain (Bm) thyme
All (Em) around the bloomin' (G) heather
Will you (D) go, (G) lassie, (D) go?

I will build my love a bower
By yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go, lassie, go?

(Chorus)

If my true love she were gone
I'd surely find another
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather
Will you go, lassie, go?


(Chorus)

I will roam through the wild
and the deep glens so dreary
and return with my spoils, 
to the bower of my dearie 
Will you go, Lassie, go? 

(Chorus)
