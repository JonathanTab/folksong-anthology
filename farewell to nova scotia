Farewell to Nova Scotia

(Chorus) (G)Farewell to Nova Scotia, your sea-bound coast,
Let your (Em)mountains dark and dreary be
When (G)I’m far away, on the (D)briny ocean tossed,
Will you (Em)ever heave a (C)sigh or a (Em)wish for me?

(G)The sun was setting in the West
The (Em)birds were singing on every tree
All of (G)nature seemed (D)inclined to rest
But, (Em)still, there (C)was no (Em)rest for me.
(Chorus)
I grieve to leave my native land
I grieve to leave my comrades all
And my poor old aged parents whom I love so dear
And the bonny, bonny lass that I do adore.
(Chorus)
The drums do beat and the wars they alarm
Our captain calls; we must obey
Farewell, farewell, to Nova Scotia’s charm
For it’s early in the morning I am bound far away
(Chorus)
I have two brothers and they are at rest.
Their hands are folded on their chest.
But a poor, simple sailor just like me
Must be tossed and turned on the deep, blue sea.
(Chorus)
