(F) Hame cam' his (C) guid horse, but (G) never came (C) he
 
Saddled and booted and bridled rode he, 
A plume tae his helmet, a sword at his knee. 
But toom came his saddle and bluidy tae see, 
Hame cam' his guid horse, but never came he
 
Doon cam' his auld mither greetin' fu' sair, 
Oot cam' his bonnie wife rivin' her hair. 
"My meadows lie green and by corn is unshorn, 
My barn it tae build and my baby's unborn."
 
High upon Hielands and low upon Tay, 
Bonnie George Campbell rode oot on a day. 
Saddled and bridled, sae bonnie rode he 
Hame cam' his guid horse, but never came he.
