Dublin Blues

Well, I (D) wished I was in (G) Austin, mmm (D)
In the Chili Parlor (A) Bar 
Drinkin' (D) Mad Dog Margaritas 
And not (G) carin' where you (D) are 
But here I sit in Dublin, mmm
Just rollin' cigarettes 
Holdin' back and chokin' back 
The shakes with every breath 

(Chorus) So (A) forgive me all my anger 
 (D) Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
 (D) For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the get go 
 (D) And I'll love you till I die 
I  (A) loved you on the Spanish Steps 
The (G) day you said goodbye 

I am just a poor boy, mmm
Work's my middle name 
If money was a reason 
Well, I would not be the same 
I'll stand up and be counted, mmm
I'll face up to the truth 
I'll walk away from trouble 
But I can't walk away from you 
(Chorus)
I have been to Fort Worth, mmm
And I have been to Spain 
And I have been too proud 
To come in out of the rain 
And I have seen the David, mmm
I've seen the Mona Lisa too 
And I have heard Doc Watson 
Play Columbus Stockade Blues 
(Chorus)
Well, I wished I was in Austin, mmm
In the Chili Parlor Bar 
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas 
And not carin' where you are
