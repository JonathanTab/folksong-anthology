All Through the Night

(D) Sleep my (G)child and (Em)peace at(A)tend thee
(G)All (A)through the (D)night
(D)Guardian (G)angels (Em)God will (A)send thee
(G)All (A)through the (D)night

(G)Soft the drowsy hours are creeping
(Em)Hill and vale in (A)slumber steeping
(D)I my (G)loving (Em)watch am (A)keeping
(G)All (A)through the (D)night

Angels watching ever 'round thee, all through the night
In thy slumbers close surround thee, all through the night
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,
Hill and dale in slumber steeping
I, my loved one, watch am keeping, all through the night.
