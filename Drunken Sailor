Drunken Sailor

(Em) What do you do with a drunken sailor,
(D) What do you do with a drunken sailor,
(Em) What do you do with a drunken sailor,
(Em) Earl-eye (D) in the (Em) morning!

(Chorus) (Em) Way hay and up she rises
(D) Way hay and up she rises
(Em) Way hay and up she rises
(Em) Earl-eye (D) in the (Em) morning

Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Earl-eye in the morning!
(Chorus)
Stick him in a barrel with a hosepipe on him
Stick him in a barrel with a hosepipe on him
Stick him in a barrel with a hosepipe on him
Earl-eye in the morning!
(Chorus)
Put him the back of the paddy wagon,
Put him the back of the paddy wagon,
Put him the back of the paddy wagon,
Earl-eye in the morning!
(Chorus)
Throw him in the lock-up 'til he's sober,
Throw him in the lock-up 'til he's sober,
Throw him in the lock-up 'til he's sober,
Earl-eye in the morning!
(Chorus)
Put him in a class with Dr. Olsson, (*Name may vary)
Put him in a class with Dr. Olsson,
Put him in a class with Dr. Olsson,
Earl-eye in the morning!
(Chorus)
What do you do with a drunken sailor,
What do you do with a drunken sailor,
What do you do with a drunken sailor,
Earl-eye in the morning!
(Chorus 2x)
