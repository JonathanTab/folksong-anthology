Loss of the Bay Rupert 

Now the Hudson Bay Company runs its ships in the summertime,
And they stock the stores of the Labrador
And they stock them full for the wintertime,
The Bay Rupert ran in '28, bound down for Baffin land,
But to get to Hopedale don't you know - you'd be better off by land.

Oh, They've got no charts for the Labrador - all you hear is: "Stay away",
There's rocks and ice, dark as hell at night from old Jack Lane's Way to Broomfield Bay,
There's wooden ships, steamer ships, They got frozen men below,
There's mountains right beneath your keel, so for God's sake don't you go.

She had shoes and coffee, boots and tea, she had butter, pipes and bridles,
Sleeping bags and saddle soap and a dozen score of bibles,
She was open wide, steamin through the tide when she hit that granite rock,
And with a mighty sound, both her ends went down and her middle opened up.

It was Sunday when that ship went down, and the town was all at prayer,
But no missionary minister or the Word of God could have kept them there,
"All's lost! All's lost!" The captain cried; "I'll never sail the more!",
"All's found, all's found!"; cried the Eskimos as they waited by the shore.

Well?. the tide come and the goods did too, and they saved them from the sea,
And they said "It's great doing business with the Hudson Bay Company",
"We got shoes and coffee, boots and tea, butter, pipes and bridles,
Sleeping bags and saddle soap - but to hell with all them bibles!"
