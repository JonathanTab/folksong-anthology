The Old Churchyard

(G)Come, come with (D)me to the (Bm)old churchyard(A)
I so (D)well know that paths 'neath the soft green (G)sward
Friends in there that we want stay regard;
We can trace out their names in the old churchyard

(D)Mourn not for them, for their trials are o'er
And (Bm)why weep for (G)those who will (D)weep no (A)more?
For (G)sweet is their (D)sleep, though (Bm)cold and (A)hard
Their (D)pillows lay deep in the old (G)churchyard

I know that it's vain when our friends depart
To breathe kind words to a broken heart;
And I know that the joy of life is marred
When we follow lost friends to the old churchyard

But were I at rest 'neath yonder tree
(Oh), why would you weep, my friends, for me?
I'm so weary, so wayworn, why would you retard
The peace that I seek in the old churchyard?

Why weep for me, for I'm ready(anxious) to go
To that haven of rest where no tears ever flow;
And I fear not to enter that dark lonely tomb
Where our Savior has lain and conquered the gloom

I rest in the hope that one bright day
Sunshine will burst to these prisons of clay
And (old)Gabriel's trumpet and then voice of the Lord
Will wake up the dead in the old churchyard.
