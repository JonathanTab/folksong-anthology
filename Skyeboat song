Skye Boat Song

(Chorus) (D) Speed, bonnie (Bm) boat, like a (Em) bird on the (A) wing,
(D) Onward! The (G) sailors (D) cry;
Carry the lad that's born to be King
Over the sea to Skye.

(Bm) Loud the winds howl, (Em) loud the waves roar,
(D) Thunderclaps (Bm) rend the (G) air;
(Bm) Baffled, our foes (Em) stand by the shore,
(D) Follow they (Bm) will not (G) dare. (A)
(Chorus)
Manyâ€™s the lad, fought in that day
Well the claymore did wield;
When the night came, silently lay
Dead on Culloden's field.
(Chorus)
Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
Ocean's a royal bed.
Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head.
(Chorus)
Burned are their homes, exile and death
Scatter the loyal men;
Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath
Charlie will come again.
