Wayfaring Stranger

(Am)I’m just a poor warfarin’ stranger,
Traveling’ (Dm)through this world be(Am)low
There is no sickness, no toil, no danger,
In that bright (Dm)land to (E)which I (Am)go.,

I’m going (F)there to see my (C)father.
And all my (F)loved ones who’ve gone (E)on
I’m just (Am)going over Jordan
I’m just (Dm)going(E) over (Am)home

I know dark clouds will gather ‘round me,
 I know my way is hard and steep.
But beauteous fields arise before me,
Where God’s redeemed, their vigils keep.

I’m going there to see my mother.
She said she’d meet me when I come.
I’m just going over Jordan
I’m just going over home

I’m just going over Jordan
I’m just going over home
