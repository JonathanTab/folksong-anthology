Charlie Mops

A long time ago, way back in history,
When all they had to drink was nothing but cups of tea,
Along came a mane by the name of Charlie Mopps,
And he invented a wonderful drink and he made it out of hops
 
(Chorus)
He might have been an Admiral,
a Sultan or a King
And to his praises we shall always sing.
Look what he has done for us: he's filled us with cheer.
God bless Charlie Mopps, the man who invented beer beer beer tiddily beer beer beer
 
A barrel of malt a bucket of hops
and add some yeast
put it all together and let it ferment and swell
When it's brewed and ready at 11 o'clock we'll stop
for 5 short seconds we'll remember Charlie Mopps
(Chorus)
 
(Put your local pubs here)
At Carnsies and the Flat Iron
and Pickle Bill's as well
One thing I can be sure of
It's Charlie's beer they sell
Some come along you lucky lads
at 11 o'clock we'll stop
for 5 short seconds we'll remember Charlie Mopps
(1..2..3..4..5)
(Chorus)
