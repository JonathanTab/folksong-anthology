Dark Old Waters

(G)Don't be thinking of me,
All (C)away and (D)alone,   
On the (C)rolling old (D)sea,
On the (C)foreign (G)ground,
For (C)I laid your keel and that's (D)dandy for me
On the (C)dark old (C)waters, (C)all a(G)lone.
Where you (C)go, go (D)well, and a (C)fair wind (G)home.
 
Don't be thinking of me on the rolling old sea
For I raised your frame and that's bully for me

And where will you go with your rail dipping low?
And where you may wander there's none can know 

Don't be thinking of me on the rolling old sea,
For I hung your canvas and sent you to sea

And where will you be when the winter comes nigh?
And where will you be when I'm thinking of thee?

And how stands the wind? Will he come as a friend
And keep you from dangers that lie off the land?

And how stand the stars in the whispering dawn?
May they guide you and bless you and the seas sail you on
…Oh hey, oh ho, heave an oar and go

Oh where will you bide at the end of your ride,
And who'll sing you songs when I'm not at your side?
