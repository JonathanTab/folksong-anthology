Drill ye terriers, drill 
Every morning at seven o’clock
There’s twenty tarriers a-workin’ at the rock
The boss comes along and he says, “Keep still
And come down heavy on the cast iron drill.”

(Chorus) So drill, ye tarriers, drill
         Drill, ye tarriers, drill
         Oh it’s work all day for the sugar in your tay
         Down beyond the railway
         So drill, ye tarriers, drill.

Our new foreman is John McCann
I’ll tell you sure, he’s a blamed mean man
Last week a premature blast went off
And a mile in the air went big Jim Goff. Refrain
(Chorus)
Next time payday comes around
Jim Goff was short one buck he found
“What for?” asked he, then this reply
“You were docked for the time you were up in the sky.”
