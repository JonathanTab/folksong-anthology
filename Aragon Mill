(Chorus) (D)And the only tune I hear
Is the sound of the wind
As it (A)blows through the town
Weave and (G)spin, weave and (D)spin

At the east end of town, at the foot of the hill
Stands a chimney so tall that says "Aragon Mill."
(Chorus)
But there's no smoke at all coming out of the stack
The mill has shut down and it ain't a-coming back
(Chorus)
Well, I'm too old to work, and I'm too young to die
Tell me, where shall we go, My old gal and I?
(Chorus)
There's no children at all in the narrow empty street
The mill has closed down; it's so quiet I can't sleep
(Chorus)
Yes, the mill has shut down; it's the only life I know
Tell me, where will I go, Tell me, where will I go?
(Chorus)
