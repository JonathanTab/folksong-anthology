The Moonshiner

(Chorus) I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, well, leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
And the moonshine don't kill me, I'll live til I die
 
I've been a moonshiner for many a year
I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
I'll go to some hollow, I'll set up my still
And I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill
(Chorus)
I'll go to some hollow in this counterie
Ten gallons of wash I can go on a spree
No women to follow, the world is all mine
I love none so well as I love the moonshine
(Chorus)
Oh, moonshine, dear moonshine, oh, how I love thee
You killed me old father, but donâ€™t you try me
God Bless all moonshiners and Bless all moonshine
Their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine
