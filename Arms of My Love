The Arms of my love 

(C)Silver moon sailing (Em)high
Cross the (Am)wide praire (Em)sky
Lead me (Dm)home to the (G)arms of my (C)love (G)
Why did (C)I ever (Em)go
Chasen' (Am)cattle and (Em)rainbows
Far (Dm)away from the (G)arms of my (C)love (G)

Does she (F)wait by the fire light
(Em)Ride through the long night
Does she (Dm)dream of the cowboy
Who (D7)rode through her (G)heart

Dusty trails lead me on
And I'll never roam
Never more
From the arms of my love
