You are my flower 

(Chorus) (G)You are my flower
         That’s blooming in the mountain so (D7)high
         You are my flower
         That’s blooming there for (G)me

(G)When summertime is gone and snow begins to (D7)fall
You can sing this song and say to one and (G)all
(Chorus)
So wear a happy smile and life will be worthwhile
Forget the tears but don’t forget to smile
