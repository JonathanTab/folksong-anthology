I Guess he'd Rather Be In Colorado

I (D)guess he'd rather (C)be in (G)Colorado
He'd (D)rather spend his (C)time out where the (G)sky looks like a (D)pearl after a (C)rain
Once (G)again I see him walkin Once (D)again I hear him talking to the (Em)stars he makes
And (C)asking them for (G)bus fare

I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
He'd rather play his banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely gone
In the dawn the subways comin in the dawn I hear him hummin'
Some old song he wrote of love in Boulder Canyon

I guess he'd rather be in Colorado

I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
I guess he'd rather work out where the only thing you earn is what you spend
In the end up in his office
In the end a quiet cough is all he has to show
He lives in New York City
