Tell Me Ma

(Chorus) O (G) Tell me ma when (C) I go (G) home
The (D) boys won't leave the (G) girls alone
They (G) pull my hair, they (C) stole my (G) comb
But (D) that's all right till (G) I go home
She is handsome, (C) she is pretty
(G) She is the belle of (D) Belfast city
(G) She is a-courting (C) one two three
(G) Pray, would you (D) tell me (G) who is she

Albert Mooney says he loves her
All the boys are fighting for her
Knock at the door and they ring that bell
Oh my true love, are you well
Out she comes as white as snow
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
Old Jenny Murray says she will die
If she doesn't get the fella with the roving eye
(Refrain)

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high
And the snow come toppling from the sky
She's as sweet as apple pie
And she'll get her own lad by and by
When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell her ma till she comes home
Let them all come as they will
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still
(Refrain)
