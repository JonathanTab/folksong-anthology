Some Tyrant

Some tyrant has stolen my true love away
And here in old England I can no longer stay
I'll cross the wide ocean, ne'er on my bed rest
In search of my true love that I love the best

When that I've found out my joy and my delight
I will welcome her kindly by day and by night
Here's a health to all others that are loyal and just
And here's confusion to the rivals that lives in distrust

There's Venus and Volume they are both joined as one
So keep yourselves single as you and I have done
So keep yourselves single and constant I'll retire
Unto her like some Venus that flourishes like fire

The bugle shall speak and the serpent shall sing
There'll be instruments of music for to make the valleys ring
Oh the huntsman he'll holler and the hounds make their noise
For to fill my love's heart with ten thousand bright joys
