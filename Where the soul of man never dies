Where The Soul Of Man Never Dies

(C)To Canaan's land, I'm (F)on my way,
Where the (C)soul of man never (G)dies.
My (C)darkest night will (F)turn to day,
Where the (C)soul of (G)man never (C)dies.

(Chorus) No (C)sad fare(F)wells. (Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells.)
         No (C)tear dimmed (G)eyes (There'll be no tear dimmed eyes.)
         Where (C)all is (F)love, (Where all is peace and joy and love.)
         And the (C)soul (G)never dies. (And the soul of man never dies.)

The rose is blooming there for me,
Where the soul of man never dies.
And I will spend eternity,
Where the soul of man never dies.
(Chorus)
The love light beams across the foam,
Where the soul of man never dies.
It shines and lights the way to home,
Where the soul of man never dies.
(Chorus) x2
