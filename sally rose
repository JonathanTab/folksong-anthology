Sally Rose
The (D) prettiest girl out west,
The (G) one I loved the best,
I have to (A) say is the sweet Sally (D) Rose.
With her long brown hair, and grace beyond compare
Why I love her only God knows.

Sally (G) Rose, Sally (D) Rose
Why do I love you, do you (A) suppose?
Is it the (D) way you sing with me,
or the (G) smile I receive
(A) every time a joke comes or (D) goes?

Well is her beauty true, or is her innocence too?
Indeed it's to the like I had never seen.
But she shall be respected, I'll give more than's expected,
And treat her as my very own queen.
(Chorus)
Sally Rose had to go miles and miles away.
Oh how I wish that she could have stayed.
But she's across the open sea, far away from me.
Still I hope that she will hear me say:
(Chorus)
And the prettiest girl out west,
The one I loved the best,
I'll have to say is that sweet Sally Rose
