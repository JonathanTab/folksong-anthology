Orphan Girl 

(C)I am an orphan on God's (G)highway
But I'll share my (C)troubles if you go my (F)way
I have no (C)mother, no (G)father
No (C)sister, no (F)brother
(C)I am an (G)orphan (C)girl

I have had friendships, pure and golden
But the ties of kinship, I have not known them
I know no mother, no father
No sister, no brother
I am an orphan girl

But when He calls me I will be able
To meet my family at God's table
I'll meet my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
No more orphan girl

Blessed Savior, make me willing
And walk beside me until I'm with them
Be my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
I am an orphan girl
