Molly Malone

In (G) Dublin's fair (Em) city
Where the (Am) girls are so (D) pretty
I (G) first set my (Em) eyes on sweet (Am) Molly Ma-(D)-lone
As she (G) wheeled her wheel-(Em)-barrow
Through the (Am) streets broad and (D) narrow
Crying (G) "cockles and (Em/C) mussels, (D) alive, alive, (G) oh"
(G) Alive, alive, (Em) oh
(Am) Alive, alive, (D) oh
Crying (G) "cockles and (Em/C) mussels, (D) alive, alive, (G) oh"
She was a fishmonger
And sure, t'was no wonder
For so were her mother and father before
And they wheeled their barrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"
(Refrain)
She died of a fever
And sure, so one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"
(Refrain 2x)
