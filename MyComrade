My Comrade

Fighting bravely in the battle
Galloping on and on,
Riding in the ranks of horsemen
Thou wert my dearest comrade
Thou the one I loved the most, (x2)
 
An arrogant Cavalier
The strongest of his corps 
Lunged at me in thirst of blood
But thy faithful love showed no fear
And thy heart the lance did find (x2)
 
Iâ€™ve avenged this mortal wound
That thou received in my stead
Deep and deep into the dark of night 
I have wept for thee my comrade
Kneeling by thy holy grave, (x2)
 
In my sadness, how I wander
 Without meaning I must ride
From this o so deadly ambush 
I have lost my dearest comrade
I will never laugh again, (x2)
 
O prince pray thee, hear my ballade
Listen to my pleading call
I pray God who loves the soldier 
To quickly place him, my comrade, 
At the right of Christ the Lord, (x2)
