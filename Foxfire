Foxfire 

When I was young and free
and not so very brave
my friends and I had a place 
that we called "Devils cave"

We'd meet out there after dark
tell tales by candle light
and event that marked all of our lives 
happened there one night

The evening it was bitter cold 
and the starts were shining hard
the wind cut through the leafless trees 
as a razor through a cord

The feeble glow from the candle flame
Brought us no warmth at all
soon a fire was raging in its place
shadows on the cavern wall

That night the legend offered 
was a hard one to believe
but with a chilling wind and warming glow 
a spell began to weave

A tale of a native nation
and a culture that's long past
and a people caught up in a flux 
in a land that was so vast

A dream about dark rumors
over murder that was done
against the whites off to the east 
at the setting of the sun

A dream of a council that was called
and punishment proclaimed
'twas banishment for the one accused
to sooth all those inflamed

Now it was later in that year
in the season of the change
when the rut of stag and the russet tones
spread throughout the range

A ghostly figure hovered
in the valley growing bright
'tis the evil the shaman said
who haunts us here at night

So a council was convened 
and a party then dispatched
they were to find the ghostly fiend
its path they were to match

It lead unto a barren cave
where the river ran so wide
the pursuers built a fore so high
the smoke was drawn inside

Not long after flames were 
licking at the cavern floor
then the evil one now all ablaze
came screaming through the door

Out to the river's edge 
where the river ran so cold
it plunged into the blackened waves
its soul they did enfold

It was found the banished one
had played the ghostly fiend
it was the foxfire made him glow
even as the river gleamed

So it was called the "Devils Cave" 
that he ran from the night
and it was called the "Devils Cave"
where we held our vigil rite

Now as the evil one 
came screaming though the cavern door
I awoke and found my friends asleep
a-lyin' on the floor

The fire, it had spent itself
smoke filled the dark and damp
the cavern closed in all around
our breath caught in a clamp

And as the moment for our deaths
upon us did appear
a flaming figure split the dark
the "evil one" drew near"

But we all followed close behind
that specter through the door
and out into the evening chill
to breath the air once more

I am told the story's true
there lived an Indian
who rubbed the foxfire on himself
and met a burning end

Perhaps it was his spirit
that appeared to us the night
perhaps to set the record straight
he used the foxfire light
