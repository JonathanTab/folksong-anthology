Isnâ€™t It Grand Boys

Look at the coffin, with golden handles 
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead? 

(Chorus) Let's not have a sniffle,
 let's have a bloody-good cry 
And always remember: The longer you live 
The sooner you'll bloody-well die 

Look at the flowers, all bloody withered 
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead? 
(Chorus)
Look at the mourners, bloody-great hypocrites 
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead? 
(Chorus)
Look at the preacher, a bloody-nice fellow 
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead? 
(Chorus)

Look at the widow, bloody-great female 
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead? 
(Chorus)
