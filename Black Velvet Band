The Black Velvet Band
In a (D) neat little town they called Belfast
Apprentice to trade I was (A) bound
And (D) many an hour sweet (Bm) happiness
Have I (G) spent in that (A) neat little (D) town
As (D) sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the (A) land
Far (D) away from me friends and (Bm) relations
(G) Betrayed by the (A) black velvet (D) band

Her (D) eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the (A) land (And she was!) 
And her (D) hair, it hung over her (Bm) shoulder
Tied (G) up with a (A) black velvet (D) band

I took a stroll down broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
Come a-traipsing along the highway
She was both fair and handsome
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
(Chorus)
I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said, was
Bad 'cess to the black velvet band
(Chorus)
Before the judge and the jury
Next morning, I had to appear
The judge, he says to me:
"Young man, you're case it is proven clear
 Seven long years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band" 
(Chorus)
So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
They'll feed you with strong drink (Oh yeah!)
'Till you are unable to stand
And the very first thing that you'll know is
You've landed in Van Diemens Land 
(Chorus)
