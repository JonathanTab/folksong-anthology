The shores of botany bay

(Chorus) Farewell to your bricks and mortar
         Farewell to your dirty lime
         Farewell to your gangways and your gang planks
         And to hell with your overtime
         For the good ship Ragamuffin is lying at the quay
         For to take oul Pat with the shovel on his back
         To the shores of Botany Bay

I'm on my way down to the quay, where the good ship lies in bay
To command a gang of navvies, I was told to engage
I stopped in for to drink a while
Thought it was okay
For to take a trip on an emigrant ship to the shores of Botany Bay
(Chorus)
Well, the foreman called this mornin'
He said "Well Pat, hello
If you didn't get them navvies out, I'm afraid you'll have to go"
I asked him for me wages
He told me "Go away"
Then I told him straight I would emigrate
To the shores of Botany Bay
You might also like
Botany Bay
(Chorus)
And when we reach Australia
I'll go and look for gold
There's plenty there for diggin' up
Or so I have been told
And if I take a notion
I'll go back to the sail
For to take oul Pat with the shovel on his back
To the shores of Botany Bay
(Chorus)
