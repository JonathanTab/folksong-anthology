Coyotes

(D)Was a cowboy I (A)knew in South (G)Texas
His (D)face was burnt (A)deep by the (G)sun
Part (D)history, part (A)sage, part (G)mesquit
He was (D)there when Poncho (A)Villa was (G)young
And he'd tell you a tale of the ol' days
When the country was wild all around
Sit out under the stars of the Milky Way
And listen while the coyotes howl

(Chorus) And they go, (D)ooh-yip, (A)ooh-yip-(G)ooh
         (D)Hoodi-ooh di-yip-(A)ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-(G)ooh
         (D)Ooh-yip, (A)ooh-yip-(G)ooh
         (D)Hoodi-ooh di-yip-(A)ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-(G)ooh

Well, he cursed all the roads and the oil men
And he cursed the automobile
Said this is no place for an hombre like I am
In this new world of asphalt and steel
Then he'd look off some place in the distance
At something only he could see
He'd say, "All that's left now of the old days
Those damned old coyotes and me"
(Chorus)
One morning, they searched his adobe
He disappeared without even a word
But that night as the moon crossed the mountain
One more coyote was heard
(Chorus) x2
