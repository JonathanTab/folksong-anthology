The Cobbler

Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler, I spent all me time at old camp 
Some call me an old agitator, but now I'm resolved to repent 
(Chorus) 
With me ingtwing of an ingthing of an idoh 
With me ingtwing of an ingthing of an iday 
With me roobooboo roobooboo randy 
And me lap stone keeps fading away 

Now, my father was hung for sheep stealing, my mother was burned for a witch 
My sister's a dandy housekeeper, and I am the son of a “Whoah!”
(Chorus) 
Ah, it’s forty long years I have travelled, all by the contents of me pack 
Me hammers, me awls and me pinchers, I carry them all on me back 
(Chorus) 
Oh, my wife she is humpy, she's lumpy, my wife she's the devil, she's black 
And no matter what I may do with her, her tongue it goes clickety-clack 
(Chorus) 
It was early one fine summer's morning, a little before it was day 
I dunked her three times in the river, and carelessly bade her "Good day!" 
(Chorus)
