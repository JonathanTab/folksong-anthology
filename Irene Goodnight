Irene Goodnight

Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
Gonna take a little stroll downtown

(Chorus) Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
         Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene
         I'll see you in my dreams
         
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I have a great notion
To jump In the river and drown
(Chorus)
Stop ramblin', stop your gamblin'
Stop stayin'out late at night
Come home to your wife and your family
And sit by the fire so bright
(Chorus)
I love Irene, God knows I do
Love her 'til the rivers run dry
If Irene should ever turn her back on me
Gonna take morphine and die
(Chorus)
