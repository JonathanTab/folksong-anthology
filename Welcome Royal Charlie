Welcome Royal Charlie

(Am)The man that should our king hae (C)been
He (G)wore the Royal red and green
A (C)bonnier (D)lad ye (G)never (Em)seen
Than (C)our young Royal (D)Charlie

When Charlie in the heilan' sheil
Forgethered wi' the Great Lochiel
Oh sic' a kindness did prevail
'Tween the Chief and Charlie

(Chorus) (G)Charlie's been too long (C)awa'
         And the (G)eagle waits for the bugle's (C)call
         But the (G)spirit shines (C)above us (D)all
         For the (G)right (C)belongs to (D)Charlie (G)
 
At Falkirk and Prestonpans
Supported by the heilan' clans
He brak the Hanoverian bands
Did our young royal Charlie

But we darenae brew a peck o' malt
But Geordie he maun ca't a fault
And for our kale we scarce get salt
For want of Royal Charlie
(Chorus)
Noo our Charlie's gone awa'
A doited German rules us all
And we are forced against the law
For want of Royal Charlie

So Charlie come and lead the way
For others here now hold the sway
But every dog maun hae it's day
So welcome Royal Charlie
(Chorus)
