Auld Lang Syne
Should (C) auld acquaintance (G) be forgot, 
And (Am) never brought to (F) mind 
Should (C) auld acquaintance (G) be forgot, 
And (F) auld (G) lang (C) syne!

(Chorus) For (C) auld lang (G) syne, my dear 
For (Am) auld lang (F) syne, 
We'll (C) take a cup o' (G) kindness yet 
For (F) auld (G) lang (C) syne!

And surely ye 'll be your pint' stowp, 
And surely I 'll be mine, 
And we 'll take a cup o' kindness yet 
For auld lang syne!
(Chorus)
We twa hae run about the braes, 
And pou'd the gowans fine, 
But we 've wander'd monie a weary fit 
Sin' auld lang syne.
(Chorus)
We twa hae paidl'd in the burn 
Frae morning sun till dine, 
But seas between us braid hae roar'd 
Sin' auld lang syne.
(Chorus)
And there's a hand, my trusty fiere, 
And gie 's a hand o' thine, 
And we 'll tak a right guid-willie waught 
For auld lang syne!
