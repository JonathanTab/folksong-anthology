WHISKEY YOU’RE THE DEVIL

(Chorus) Oh, whisky you're the devil, You're leading me astray
Over hills and mountains And to Amerikay
You're sweeter, stronger decenter 
you’re spunkier than tea
Oh whisky you're my darling drunk or sober

Now brave boys, we're on the march
Off to Portugal and Spain
Drums are beating, banners flying 
The Devil at home will come tonight
Love, fare thee well
With me tithery-right-an-doodle O ma da!
 me tithery-right-an-doodle O ma da
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o
There's whisky in the jar
(Chorus)	
Says the Mother do not wrong me
Don't take me daughter from me
For if you do I will torment you
And when I'm dead my ghost will haunt you
Love, fare thee well
With me tithery-right-an-doodle O ma da!
 me tithery-right-an-doodle O ma da
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o
There's whisky in the jar
(Chorus)
O The French are fighting boldly
Men are dying hot and coldly
Give every man his flask of powder
His firelock on his shoulder
Love fare thee well!
With me tithery-right-an-doodle O ma da!
 me tithery-right-an-doodle O ma da
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o
There's whisky in the jar
(Chorus)
