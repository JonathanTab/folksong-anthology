Fields of Athenry

By a (D) lonely prison wall, I (G) heard a young girl (D) call-(A)-ing
(D) Michael, they have (G) taken you (A) away,
For you (D) stole Trevelyan's (G) corn,
So the (D) young might see the (A) morn
Now a (Em) prison ship lies (A) waiting in the (D) bay

[Chorus] (D) Low (G) lie the (D) fields of Athen-(Bm)-ry
Where (D) once we watched the (*Bm) small free birds (A) fly
Our (D) love was on the (G) wing
We had (D) dreams and songs to (A) sing
It's so (Em) lonely round the (A) fields of Athen-(D)-ry

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
Against the famine and the crown,
I rebelled, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity
[Chorus]
By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star fall
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
For she lived to hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Chorus]
